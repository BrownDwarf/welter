1.  Intro
     -HR diagram/age/mass
     -magfield/convection
     -spots as possible solution - e.g., Stauffer Pleaides, recent Covey
     -motivation for LkCa 4 - biased selection as proof-of-concept, no disk

2.  Observations

3.  Spectral fitting
     -statistical models
     -single Temp; limitations and problems
     -two Temp results
     -spectral comparison

4.   Confirmation of results
     -reproduce colors, photometry
        --common sense of large covering fraction
     -reproduce TiO variability
     -reproduce low-res broadband spectra

5.  Implications
     -Teff, HR diagram
     -temperatures from GAIA-ESO, APOGEE, TiO (Luhman)
     -cool spot or hot spot?  inclination?  consistency with Donati+?


==================


plots
----------
1)  ASAS-SN rotation (also, long-term consistency?  any precession?)
2)  Single Temperature Fit:  Results
3)  2-Temperature fit plots:
     -all fitting results for 1 order  (rest in Appendix?)
     -some sort of contour plot with results from many orders
     -spectrum of several orders
     -expanded spectrum of key wavelength regions

4)  Synthetic SED versus photometry
     Colors versus rotation period
    TiO variability?
     Low-res spectral convolution

5)  HR diagram


Table:
---------
Final Results:  v sin i, RV, T1, T2, A2, Av, L, M, age, etc....
Maybe single T fits for a few spectral windows to show how results would differ?
