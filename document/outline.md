## Outline


- Introduction
	- Previous studies of Starspots
	- Previous studies of LkCa4
- Methodology
	- Reference Czekala et al.
		- Overview and summary of existing model
		- Table of parameter definitions
	- Deriving unique T_eff in each order with existing model
	- Modifying the model
		- New PGM
		- Mixture model definitions
- Observations
	- IGRINS spectroscopy
	- ESPaDOnS archival
	- Where in the phase of variability were the IGRINS spectra taken?
	- Where in the phase of variability were the ESPaDOnS spectra taken?
- Results
	- Results from deriving unique T_eff in each order
	- Evidence for two different temperatures as measured in the IR and optical point to spots.
	- Comparison to synthetic spectrum composite from noised-up Phoenix models
- Discussion
	- Longitudinal spot distribution
	- Full spectrum fitting procedure
- Appendix
	-Testing and tuning the mixture model
		- How does it perform with synthetic data
		- Degenerate parameters
		- Choice of sampling
		- Affine invariant transformations

## Stretch goals

- Actual whole spectrum fitting of mixture model
- Fitting of the multiple epochs of ESPaDOnS data
- Fitting with fixed priors on log-g and [Fe/H]
- Predicted limit for how small a signal we could detect
