## Outline


- Introduction
	- Previous studies of Starspots
	- Previous studies of LkCa4
- Observations
	- IGRINS spectroscopy
- Analysis
	- Data reduction
	- Whole spectrum fitting strategy
	- Priors on the other stellar parameters
	- Deriving unique T_eff in each order
	- Where in the phase of variability were the IGRINS spectra taken?
	- Where in the phase of variability were the ESPaDOnS spectra taken?
- Results
	- Evidence for two different temperatures as measured in the IR and optical point to spots.
	- Comparison to synthetic spectrum composite from noised-up Phoenix models
- Discussion
	- Longitudinal spot distribution
	- Full spectrum fitting procedure


## Stretch goals

- Actual whole spectrum fitting of mixture model
- Fitting of the multiple epochs of ESPaDOnS data
- Fitting with fixed priors on log-g and [Fe/H]
- Predicted limit for how small a signal we could detect
