- Observations
	- IGRINS spectroscopy
	- ESPaDOnS archival
	- Where in the phase of variability were the spectra taken?

	- Result 2: Effect size from fitting synthetic data order-by-order
	- Result 3: Direct measurement of spot properties with mixture model
- Discussion
	- Interpretation of distribution of stellar properties from Results 1 + 2
	- Interpretation of star spot properties from Result 3
	- Longitudinal/latitudinal spot distributions and phase
	- Address limitations of assumptions made in Methodology section
- Appendix
