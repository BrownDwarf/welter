\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%\subsection{Pre Main Sequence HR diagram spread}

For a single presumably coeval stellar cluster, pre main-sequence HR diagrams exhibit large ($\delta t_{\ast} \sim t_{\ast}$) apparent spreads in age \citep[e.g.][]{2011A&A...534A..83R}. The cause of the large spread in pre main-sequence HR diagrams is controversial: some take it as evidence for intrinsic age spreads, some take it as evidence for non static accretion history \citep{2009ApJ...702L..27B, 2010ARA&A..48..581S}.  

Still others take the large apparent age spreads in pre main-sequence HR diagrams as evidence for the limited physics included in the pre main-sequence evolutionary model isochrones.  Most modern evolutionary models do not yet include the effects of starspots or magnetic fields, despite observations betraying their presence, \emph{e.g.} optical monitoring and Zeeman doppler imaging \citep{2008A&A...479..827G,2014MNRAS.444.3220D}.  

%\subsection{Previous studies of Starspots}

Sunspots are probably responsible for biases in stellar effective temperatures derived by different methods.  For example, the APOGEE spectrograph ($1.5-1.70 \;\mu$m at $R=22,500$) measured effective temperatures for 3493 young stars finding offsets in $\teff$ of typically 200$-$500 K and as high as 1000 K compared to previous studies \citep{2014ApJ...794..125C}.  Low resolution optical spectroscopy shows a typical spread of 200 K in the spectral type-to-effective-temperature conversion scale \citep{2014ApJ...786...97H}.  These discrepancies in $\teff$ could be attributable to measurements of spectral features steming from patches of stellar photosphere with different effective temperatures than the bulk photosphere.  Single temperature photospheres are not realistic approximations for complex young photospheres possessing large areal coverage fractions of starspots.


Stellar evolution models including the effect of starspots can make a coeval 10 Myr population exhibit apparent age spreads of 3$-$10 Myr, with derived masses biased towards lower masses \citep{2015ApJ...807..174S}.  The importance of starspots needs to be empirically evaluated to assess systematic biases of pre-main sequence stellar evolutionary models.
%...develop this point more

Modeling the periodic light curves of spotted stars can answer these questions: ``What evidence is there to support the existence of starspots?  What joint constraint can be placed upon the effective temperature contrast and areal coverage of the starspots?  What is the longitudinal asymmetry of the spots?''.  Cyclical light curve variations indicate only the longitudinally asymmetric component of the star spots \citep{2012AJ....143....4H}.  Photometric modeling of the light curve taken alone can only yield degenerate estimates in the temperature contrast and areal coverage fraction.  A star possessing longitudinally symmetric distribution of starspots, or a pole-on star with a single spot, or a non-rotating (or very slowly rotating) star would all show zero or secular amplitude of photometric variability, yet they all contain star spots.  

By modeling the composite \emph{spectrum} of a spotted star, it is possible to directly measure the collective areal coverage and effective temperature contrast.  Spectroscopic modeling can still measure the starspot properties in pole-on stars, stars with longitudinally symmetric stars, and non-rotating stars.

In principle, more advanced questions could be asked about the properties of the spots: ``How many distinct spot groups are there?  Is there evidence for both hot spots and cool spots?  What is the longitudinal distribution of the spots?  What is the (co-)latitudinal distribution of the spots?  What is the distribution of effective temperature within a spot or spot group?  What are the morphologies of the spots?''.  Solving these questions would require a complex model comparison framework, combining all available data and lines of evidence from photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric monitoring.  We seek to answer the much easier questions about the aggregate properties of the stellar photosphere, assuming the star is well described by two distinct photospheric components.  

%\subsection{Previous studies of \name}

In this paper we characterize the starspot coverage and temperature contrast of \name using full spectrum fitting.  We chose \name for its likelihood of large areal coverage of starspots, as evinced by large-amplitude photometric variability  detected in $BVRI$ bands.  Its period is 3.37$\pm$0.01 days \citep{1993AJ....106.1608V,1994IBVS.4042....1G,grankin08,xiao12}.  

Recent optical spectro-polarimetry showed evidence for hot or cool starspots covering an estimated $25\%$ of the stellar surface \citep{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}.  
%This statement needs to be fact-checked, maybe some more supporting info.

The source has little or no accretion ($\log{\dot M} < 8.1$), no detection of mid-infrared nor mm excess, and no stellar companion, so its spectrum should be devoid of complicating factors like near-IR excess veiling and accretion excess.  This source is the ideal candidate for direct measurement of two-temperature photosphere due to starspots.
% These claims need references.

We extend a new spectral forward modeling framework to include two-temperature photosphere models.  We demonstrate the constraining power of full spectrum fitting with panchromatic optical and near-IR echelle spectroscopy.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methods} 

The details of the methodology are contained in Appendix \ref{methods-details}.  Here we overview the salient concepts needed to follow the results and discussion.

We experimented with several extensions to the modular framework for spectral inference described in \iancze \footnote{The open source codebase and its full revision history is available at https://github.com/iancze/Starfish.  The experimental fork discussed in this paper is at https://github.com/gully/Starfish}.  The \iancze technique forward models ``emulated'' synthetic spectra from pre-computed model grids, taking into account the discretization error attributable to the coarsely sampled stellar intrinsic parameters.  We use the \PHOENIX~ model grid. After experimenting with the base model from \iancze, we made two principal changes to the modular framework: 1) the introduction of a starspot mixture model characterized by a second $\teff$ and areal fill factor $f$, and 2) the switch from Gibbs sampling to ensemble sampling with chunking by spectral order.  We discuss these two changes below.

Following and extending the notation of \iancze, we can write down the mixture model as:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
\vM_{\mathrm{mix}}(\vT) = \vM(\teffa, ...) \times \Omega_a + \vM(\teffb, ...) \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}

where $\vM$ is the pixel-level forward model of a spectrum, and we assume the stellar photosphere is characterized as two photospheric components with different effective temperatures, $\teff$ and solid angular coverages $\Omega$, but sharing all the same intrinisic and extrinsic stellar parameters otherwise.  The observed filling factor of photosphere $b$ is simply the ratio:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:fill_factor}
f = \frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_a + \Omega_b}
\end{eqnarray}

The second important change to the spectral inference framework involves technical aspects of switching from sampling the nuisance and stellar parameters separately in a blocked Gibbs framework to ensemble sampling using \texttt{emcee} \cite{2013PASP..125..306F}.  The affine-invariant \texttt{emcee} ensemble sampler is more resilient to correlations expected among stellar temperatures and fill factor than the Metropolis-Hastings sampler used in Gibbs sampling.  The practical effect of this switch is that we obtain unique stellar parameter estimates $\vT_{o}$ for each spectral order $o$, whereas the \iancze strategy had the power to provide a single set of stellar parameters $\vT$ that was based on all $N_{\rm ord}$ spectral orders.  There is no principled way to combine the $N_{\rm ord}$ sets of inferences on $\vT_{o}$, but there are ample heuristics like taking the weighted average of the $o$ sets of marginalized posterior distributions functions.


\section{Observations and data mining}\label{sec:obs} 

\subsection{IGRINS Spectroscopy}\label{sec:igrins} 
We acquired observations with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph, IGRINS \citep{2014SPIE.9147E..1DP,2012SPIE.8450E..2SG} on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory on 2015-11-18 $09^h$ UTC.  IGRINS is a high resolution near-infrared echelle spectrograph providing simultaneous $R\simeq45,000$ spectra over 1.48-2.48\um.  The spectrograph has two arms with 28 orders in $H-$band and 25 orders in $K-band$.  The data were reduced with the Pipeline Package (citeXX).  We performed telluric correction by dividing the spectrum of \name by an A0V star observed near-contemporaneously at similar air-mass.  The broad hydrogen lines in the A0V star produced broad flux excesses in the spectrum of \name.  No effort was made to remove these flux excesses, which affect several spectral orders. 
%List the spectral orders these lines affect.

\subsection{ESPaDOnS Spectroscopy}
We combined our IGRINS spectroscopy with existing ESPaDOnS panchromatic optical echelle spectra to provide 88 spectral orders between 5100 and 25000 \AA \citep{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}.  There are 12 spectra observed over the 13 days between JD 2456665.72 and 2456678.90.  

\subsection{Photometric monitoring from ASASSN and \citet{grankin08}}

We retrieved $V-$band monitoring from the ASASSN survey \citep{2014ApJ...788...48S}.  This data covered 2012 January - 2016 March.  The 777 raw data points included near-contemporaneous measurements from repeated observations during the same visits, which lasted typically $<10$ minutes.  We grouped datapoints by these visits yielding 186 data points, assigning a mean value and standard deviation when there was more than 1 observation per visit, enforcing a floor uncertainty of 0.01, the native quoted uncertainty of the data points.  We assigned the native uncertainty of 0.01 when there was only a single observation per visit.

We also retrieved $V-$band monitoring from \citet{grankin08} which covers 1992 August - 2004 October with 284 data points.  Of those, 278 have $B-V$, 268 have $V-R$, and 18 have $U-B$.  We also compiled the 10 additional $V-$band photometric data points provided in \citet{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}.

Figure \ref{fig:PhotTime} assembles the \citet{grankin08}, \citet{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}, and ASASSN $V-$band monitoring plotted over the interval 1992-2016.  The dates of observations of the IGRINS spectra and ESPaDoNs spectra are demarcated as vertical lines.

	\caption{\name $V-$band photometric monitoring from 1992-2016.}
	\label{fig:PhotTime}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:PhotPhase} shows the phase-folded lightcurve of all available $V-$band data grouped by the 17 observing seasons.  We folded the phase by a period $P=3.375$ days, which is the median position of the peaks of the multiterm ($M_{\rm max} = 4$) Lomb-Scargle periodogram derived separately from each of the 17 observing seasons \citep{2014sdmm.book.....I}.  The standard deviation of the 17 periodogram peaks was 0.003 days.  The general appearance of the phase-folded lightcurves does not change with perturbations to the period on the scale of 0.003 days.  We estimated $\hat V$, the $V-$band magnitude at the time of the spectral observations, from a regularized multiterm fit \citep{2015ApJ...812...18V} shown as the solid blue line in Figure \ref{fig:PhotPhase}.  Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V} lists $\hat V$ and the observing epoch for the spectral observations with ESPaDoNs and IGRINS.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the ESPaDoNs spectrum}

We performed spectral fitting on the ESPaDoNs spectrum acquired on 2014 January 11, the fourth spectrum from Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V}.  We chunked the spectrum into a subset of $N_{ord}=$26 spectral orders and performed full-spectrum fitting separately on each of these 26 spectral orders following the Metropolis-Hasting MCMC sampling procedure described in \iancze.  We employed the \PHOENIX model grid with a search range of $\logg \in [3.5, 4.0]$, $\Z \in [-0.5, 0.5]$, and $\teff \in [3500, 4200]$ and trained a spectral emulator as described in \iancze.  

We tuned the Metropolis-Hasting step sizes with several iterations of burn-in procedure and visually checked the final chains for convergence.  Our number of samples was generally much longer than the estimated integrated autocorrelation length.  We spot-checked full-spectrum fits in comparison with the observed spectrum, finding modest agreement with the exception of spectral line outliers.  No attempt was made to downweight spectral-line outliers as described in \iancze.  We attempted fits to 9 more of the 35 spectral orders available for this ESPaDoNs spectrum, but the MCMC computations for these orders failed to converge, possibly due to numerical artifacts arising from poor model fits.

We computed the median value and 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentiles of burned-in subsets of the MCMC samples described above.  Overall these 26 sets of point estimates for $\vT_{m}$, $\vP_m$ show relatively good agreement, with exceptions.  We have little constraint on $\logg$ and $\Z$ since full-spectrum fitting tends to wash out the weak signal contained in line wings for spectra with a finite level of random noise and systematic error.  Meanwhile, strong metal lines can bias estimates of $\Z$ at the expense of estimates for $\teff$.  We get consistent estimates for\footnote{Note, $v_z$ is an uncorrected recessional velocity, not a proper radial velocity} $v_z \sim 15.6 \pm 0.6$ km/s and $\vsini \sim 28.0 \pm 0.9$ km/s, with the exception of two spectral orders at $6920 <\lambda \;(\mathrm{nm})< 7057$ and $8473 < \lambda \;(\mathrm{nm}) < 8706$.  These two outlying spectral orders converged to unreasonably large values for $\vsini$ and $a_{\rm G}$, the amplitude of the Gaussian process covariance kernel.  One of these orders has an unusually small value for effective temperature, $\teff\sim3500$, comparable to the lower limit of the employed model grid.  Visual comparison of the observed spectrum for a range of fits for these orders shows that no single emulated spectrum could reasonably fit their spectrum because there are numerous large spectral outliers.  The more-well-behaved spectral orders show effective temperature point estimates in the range $\teff=4000\pm130$ K.  Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder} displays the $\teff$ point estimates with 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentile error bars placed at the central wavelength of each of the 26 spectral orders for the subset of ESPaDoNs orders that received full-spectrum fitting.

	\caption{Effective temperature as derived from unique full spectrum fitting to each of 58 spectral orders in the optical through infrared portions of the spectrum assuming a single component photosphere.  }
	\label{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the IGRINS spectrum}

We performed full-spectrum fitting on 32 of the 54 available IGRINS spectral orders, again fitting unique stellar parameters $\vt = (\teff, \logg, \Z)$ for each spectral order $m$.  We used the same analysis procedure as described for the ESPaDoNs spectra, with one exception.  For the IGRINS $K-$band, we employed an expanded search range for the effective temperature, $\teff \in [3000, 4200]$ K, since the IGRINS $H-$ band demonstrated some saturation at the $\teff=3500$ K lower bound.  No effort was made to shift the wavelength scales of the IGRINS data and $\PHOENIX$ model into the same system, so the absolute values of $v_z$ are arbitrary shifted.

We find a larger dispersion in the point estimates for the stellar parameters derived from the IGRINS data with single temperature fits.  The most conspicuous trend is in the derived effective temperature as a function of wavelength shown in Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}.  Here we see dramatic result that the effective temperature peaks at a values of $\sim4200$K in the short wavelength end of $H-$band and saturates at $<3500$ K at the long wavelength end of $H-$band.  The $K-$band shows even lower derived effective temperatures of $\sim3300$ K.

\subsection{Interpretation of the single temperature fitting results}

There is a $\Delta \teff \sim 800$ K difference in the effective temperature derived at different wavelength intervals for the same stellar spectrum.  To put this level of effective temperature in context, authors using 4200 K and 3300 K values would conclude evolutionary model derived masses of XX or YY as shown in Figure XX. 
\todo{Put in the numbers and HR diagram figure here.}

It is clear that the single-temperature model is a poor fit to the data.  Our model assumptions were incorrect: no single temperature can describe all the spectral lines present in the spectra.  This discrepancy is circumstantial evidence for the direct detection of spectral lines attributable to starspots.  This circumstantial evidence should not be surprising given the previous evidence that \name possesses a large coverage fraction of starspots \citep{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}, along with its large amplitude of photometric variations, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PhotPhase} and discussed previously by \citet{grankin08}.

We performed a further plausibility check to constrain the effect size of starspots.  We generated flux calibrated spectra at two temperatures, and forward-modeled them to resemble the LkCa4 IGRINS and ESPaDOnS spectra in all other ways (\emph{i.e.} $\logg, \Z, \vt_{\rm ext}$), including noise and calibration parameters.  We coadded the spectra in a mixture model:  $ \mathsf{M}_{mix} = c \cdot \mathsf{M}_A(T_\textrm{eff,A}) + (1-c) \cdot \mathsf{M}_B(T_\textrm{eff,B})$.  We chose a fill factor of starspots of 30\%.  We then re-ran our single-temperature fitting procedure on the two-temperature, synthetic, noised-up data to see what stellar parameters our full-spectrum fitting procedure would na\"{\i}vely derive.  
\comm{I don't think I ever put together a figure for this, should we just skip it?  I think so.}


\subsection{Heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines in the infrared}

Some care should be taken when directly comparing results between the ESPaDoNs and IGRINS spectra since they were not taken at the same time.  These spectra have comparable albeit different $\hat V$ of 12.90 and 12.83 for the ESPaDoNs and IGRINS spectra respectively.  If we assume the areal coverage fraction of spots was the same or greater during the ESPaDoNs spectrum acquisition, we can derive the result that the optical bands and short-wavelength end of $H$-band are relatively insensitive to the spectral signatures of starspots in this system.  The long wavelength portion of $H-$band and all of $K-$band are more sensitive to starspot spectral signatures than the shorter wavelength portions.

We can understand the heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines as wavelength increases in the following way.  The effective temperature of a starspot is, by definition, cooler than its surrounding photosphere, and will therefore have a longer wavelength of peak emission, according to Wein's displacement law.  So the ratio of flux density between starspot and bulk photosphere as function of wavelength will generally increase with wavelength until it assymptotes to a fixed value in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail.  In Figure XX we plot the ratio of black body flux density at temperatures 4100 K and 3300 K with a red line.  The blue line is the ratio of two smoothed \PHOENIX model spectra with 4100 K and 3300 K with solar metalicity and $\logg=3.5$.  The flux density ratio is the flux per solid angle, so the delivered flux ratio for a finite sized starspot will depend on the (flux-weighted) solid angle of the starspot relative to the (flux-weighted) solid angle of the stellar disk, vis-a-vis Equations \ref{eqn:Mix_M} and \ref{eqn:fill_factor}.  

\todo{Put in the flux density ratio plot.}

\comm{Should we change the plot numbers from 4100 and 3300 to 4200 and 3000?  -These would end up being closer to the best fit values.}

In summary, the visible portion of the spectrum will be dominated by the warm patches, but the contrast with the starspots will be higher.  The infrared spectrum will have a lower overall spot contast, but will have higher relative contribution attributable to the cool patches.  This observation has motivated precision radial velocity (RV) planet searches in the infrared, where the modulation of RV signals is lessened \citep{2008ApJ...687L.103P}.  
\comm{This blurb should probably go in the introduction.}


\subsection{Two-temperature fitting to IGRINS spectra}

Motivated by the failure of single-temperature model full-spectrum fitting, we added two new model parameters our forward model: a starspot temperature and a fill factor, as described by Equation \ref{eqn:Mix_M}.  We also altered the model as described in Section \ref{sec:methods} and detailed in Appendix \ref{methods-details}.  

Figure \ref{fig:TwoTempResults} shows the starspot and photospheric temperature derived independently for 43 IGRINS orders.

\section{Monitoring the Spots of LkCa 4}

The previous sections established that the high resolution optical and near-IR spectra of LkCa 4 may be explained by a cool photosphere with a hot spot.  In this section, we will demonstrate that this same model explains the broadband spectral energy distribution and flux-calibrated optical/near-IR spectra of LkCa 4.  Periodic variability in photometry and spectral indices are reproduced by modest changes in the visible fraction of the hot spot.

\subsection{Reproducing the Spectral Energy Distribution}

\subsection{TiO Variability}

The depth of TiO and other molecular bands are a common diagnostic of spectral type (and temperature) in optical spectra.  In the 12 ESPaDOnS spectra of \name\ obtained over 14 days \citep{2014MNRAS.444.3220D}, the depth of the TiO bands vary.  


Each of the TiO spectral index is correlated with the other indices.  The line depths also correlate with the V-band magnitude, as estimated from the ASAS-SN photometry and the V-band photometry provided in \citep{2014MNRAS.444.3220D} that were obtained within 6 months of the ESPaDOnS observations.  

Needs a lot more.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of distribution of stellar properties from Results 1 + 2}

We interpret the cooler temperatures derived at $K-$band in Approach 12 as the presence of sunspots contributing more flux at longer wavelengths, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:teffOrder}.  Here we show the absolute flux ratio, $f_{\lambda, B} / f_{\lambda, A}$ at two different temperatures: $T_\textrm{eff,A} = 4100$ and $T_\textrm{eff,B} = 3300$.  We present the ratio of two synthetic spectra from Phoenix (blue solid line), and the black body ratio (red dashed line).  

The systematically different teffs seen in Approach 12 could also be attributable to magnetic fields (cite XX).

\section{Methodological details}
\label{methods-details}

\subsection{Full-spectrum fitting framework}

% Motivation:  Why sampling?  Why full spectrum fitting?

A main motivating factor in designing our methodology was our wish to address the question: ``Is a given spectrum consistent with the non-detection of starspots, and to what level of confidence can the properties of starspots be measured given uncertain stellar properties?''.  In order to answer this question, we need some way to gauge the uncertainty in the derived stellar properties, which we assumed would have some level of degeneracy among themselves.  For example, we expect the best fit effective temperature contrast will be partially degenerate with the areal coverage fraction: a slightly cooler, smaller sunspot can masquerade as a larger, warmer spot.  This degeneracy should be lessened in spectroscopic methods compared to photometric methods.  The desire to reveal these intra-parameter degeneracies motivated the choice of \emph{sampling} from the posterior probability density distribution function.

% Overview and summary of existing model

We adopted and extended an existing modular framework for spectral inference \citep[][hereafter \iancze]{2015ApJ...812..128C}.  We briefly summarize the model here for carity of notation, but see \iancze for more details.  We follow and expand the notation from \iancze, all summarized in Table \ref{table:params}. 

The main idea is that \iancze define a pixel-level forward model $\vM$ of the data.  A flexible Gaussian Process noise model handles correlations in the residual spectrum, $\vR= \vD - \vM$.  The model encapsulates the major intrinsic stellar parameters $\vt_{\ast}$ and the extrinsic stellar parameters $\vt_{\rm ext}$:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:scaling}
\vM(\vT) &=& \vM(\vt_{\ast}, \vt_{\rm ext}) \\
         &=& \vM(\vt_{\ast}, \sigma_v, v\sin{i}, v_r) \times \Omega \times 10^{-0.4\,A_{\lambda}}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The $\vt_{\ast}$ are comprised of the dimensions of the pre-computed stellar model grid.  We use the \PHOENIX model grid \citep{2013A&A...553A...6H}, with fixed solar alpha abundances: $\A = 0$, so $\vt_{\ast} = \{\teff, \logg, \Z \}$.

\subsection{Approach 11: Whole spectrum with a single photospheric component (Czekala et al. 2015)}

Approach 11 is identical to the strategy in \iancze.  The model $\vM(\vT)$ was intended to apply a single set of stellar parameters to the entire wavelength range of interest, presumably the entire available spectrum.  For a spectrum from a multi-order echelle spectrograph, this means each spectral order is fit with the same stellar parameters.  Simultaneous fitting is the desired behavior for most applications involving a single stellar photospheric component.  In our case, however, we know that a single stellar photospheric component is a poor model for the data: there are \emph{two or more components} lurking in the composite spectrum.  We anticipate that these fits would be too uninformative, so we did not implement Approach 11 on the whole spectrum.

\textbf{Other things to say: Optical and IR will have slightly different RV, perhaps different vsini based on erroneous spectral resolution.  This method could work with liberal assignment of local kernels, and the development of new kernels that deal with line-width mis-matches.}

\subsection{Approach 12: Deriving unique Teff in each order}
\label{sec:approach12}

In local chunks of wavelength, a single stellar photosphere component might fit the composite spectrum satisfactorily.  Some wavelength chunks will fit the warm photosphere lines better and other wavelength chunks will fit prominent lines from cool spots better.  Wavelength chunks possessing lines that are present in both cool and warm stars will yield mixed results.

The starspot contrast depends on wavelength, roughly as the ratio of blackbodies.  Figure XX shows a plot of the flux ratio of two stellar photospheres with identical stellar properties except for different effective temperatures.  So a sufficiently large bandwidth spectrum could exhibit differing levels of fit quality as a function of wavelength, if a single temperature photosphere fit is naively applied to different chunks of wavelengths.  

We modified the \iancze spectral inference framework to fit $\vM$ in each spectral order \emph{independently}: $\vT \rightarrow \vT_o$, where $o$ signifies the spectral order, which could stem from multiple spectrographs, each with multiple orders.  

This change does not represent reality: by definition, the star has a single set of stellar properties, which do not depend on the wavelength range at which they are measured.  The na\"ive single-component fit to different wavelength chunks merely provides a plausibility argument for the presence of a second photospheric component if the derived $\vT_o$ show a spread in $\teff$.  

It is conceivable that other parameters, like $\logg$ could show a dependence on wavelength if non-standard physics---\emph{i.e.}physics not included in the pre-computed model grid---mimics the effect of \emph{e.g.} $\logg$ on the spectrum.  For example, magnetic fields could cause Zeeman broadening, which could alter the derived stellar parameters $\vT_o$.  For these reasons, we intentionally allowed \emph{all} the stellar parameters $\vT_o = \{T_{\mathrm{eff},o}, \log{g_o}, \Z_o, \Omega_{o}, v\sin{i}_o, v_{r,o}\}$ to vary by order.  

In principle, one could refine the inference on $T_{\mathrm{eff},o}$ in an \emph{empirical Bayes'} strategy CITE (XX, astroML book?), in which we re-evaluate $\vT_o$ by setting priors on all the stellar parameters except $T_{\mathrm{eff},o}$.  We elected not to pursue an empirical Bayes' approach.

As a side benefit, the strategy of fitting $\vT_o$ in each spectral order provides a useful check on instrumental calibration. If the stellar parameters in one order are routinely discrepant, we can examine and refine our instrumental calibration for that spectral order.  For example, the radial velocity $v_r$ could be systematically offset in one order due to instrumental calibration problems.  Or perhaps the $v\sin{i}$ could show a dependence on wavelength, since the spectral inference framework from \iancze assumes the spectral resolution is fixed across all wavelengths, but typical spectrographs exhibit a small dependence of spectral resolution on wavelength.  (cite the SICK paper)

Spectral-order level granularity in fit quality is not available in a fit that includes all $N_{order}$ spectral orders.  In fact, the benefits of spectral chunking could be made \emph{even more granular} by chunking the spectrum into individual spectral lines or line-groups.  The fit quality could then be assessed on a line-by-line basis, even taking into account systematic effects like individual elemental abundance patterns beyond the coarse $\Z$ estimates.  Future improvements to the spectral inference framework are directed at implementing this spectral-line chunking strategy.  

\subsection{Approach 21: Whole spectrum with two components}
\label{sec:approach21}

Ideally, we want to fit the entire spectrum with a two component photosphere.  If we believe our model, the entire emergent spectrum of the star should be described by a single set of stellar parameters.  In other words, if nature had truly delivered a noisy version of this model, the ability to measure starspot properties would scale with the number of spectral channels (to some power).

Unfortunately there are two main limitations of Approach 21.  First, the Metropolis-Hastings Gibbs sampling is dramatically complicated by increasing from 6 to 8 stellar parameters: $theta-original to theta-multicomponent$.  The details of the problem are summarized in Section \ref{sec:MC-challenges}.


\subsection{Approach 22: Order-by-order with two components}
\label{sec:approach22}

Finally, Approach 22 is two sample each spectral order with a unique two-component photosphere model: 

$$ theta by order$$. 

In this case we altered the \iancze framework from a blocked Gibbs sampler with Metropolis-Hastings proposals to an affine invariant ensemble sampler with all stellar and nuisance parameters sampled simultaneously.  

This strategy has the \emph{disadvantage} that there is no statistically principled way to combine the $N_{ord}$ inferences from the set of $\theta$ at the end.  There are many \emph{heuristic} ways to estimate the inferences at the end.  


\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Mixture model definitions}

We construct a mixture model spectrum of the form:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
\vM_{\mathrm{mix}}(\vT) = \vM(\teffa, ...) \times \Omega_a + \vM(\teffb, ...) \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}


Where $\teffa, \teffb, \Omega_a, \Omega_b$ are temperatures and solid angles of two photospheric components respectively.  All other stellar intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and instrumental nuisance calibration parameters are shared among the two components, as chronicled in Table \ref{table:params}.

If the stellar models are in absolute flux units, our mixture model is complete as stated in Equation \ref{eqn:mix_M}.  However \iancze employ \emph{standardized} $\flam$ when constructing the forward model $\vM$:


\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:normalization}
\bar \flam = \frac{\flam}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \flam d\lambda} = \frac{\flam}{f}
\end{eqnarray}

The reason for standardizing the flux is a matter of practicality: the number of PCA eigenspectra components in the spectral emulator scales steeply with the pixel-to-pixel variance of $f_{\lambda}(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$, increasing the computational cost of spectral emulation.  The choice to standardize fluxes makes no difference for modeling a single photospheric component.  But for two-component photosphere models, the relative flux of the two model spectra needs to be accounted for to get an accurate estimate of the areal coverage fraction of the cool spots, $c \equiv \Omega_b/(\Omega_a+\Omega_b)$.  So we scale the mixture model in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:norm_scaling}
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}} &=& f_{\mathrm{a}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + f_{\mathrm{b}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b \\
q &=& q(\vt_{\ast})\equiv \frac{f_{\mathrm{b}}(\teffb, ...)}{f_{\mathrm{a}}(\teffa, ...)} \\
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}}^{\prime} &=& \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + q \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}

where the prime symbol in the final line indicates a re-standarized mixture model flux, where the relative fluxes of the model components are now correctly scaled.

We are then tasked with computing an estimator, $\hat f(\vt_{\ast})$, for estimating the scale factor $q$ in-between model gridpoints.  The Right Thing to Do would be to follow \iancze by training a Gaussian process on the $f(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$.  What We Actually Did was linearly interpolate between the model grid-points.  Interpolation can cause pile-up near model grid-points, as noted in \citet{2014ApJ...794..125C}, which motivated the spectral emulation procedure in \iancze.  We assume the interpolation of $\hat f$ is smooth enough that we will not see such pileups and if even we did see pileups, they would mostly be discernable in the distribution of samples in the starspot areal coverage fraction $c$.  One drawback of our estimator method compared to the Gaussian Process regression method is that we do not propagate the uncertainty associated with the absolute flux ratio interpolation into our estimate of $c$.  We assume this uncertainty is relatively small and can be ignored.

The mixture model is a linear operation with all the same stellar extrinsic parameters, so we can re-use all the same post-processed eigenspectra $\widetilde{\mathbf{\Xi}}$, mean spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\mu$, and variance spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\sigma$, with the tildes representing all post processing \emph{except} the $\Omega$ scaling.  We calulate \emph{two} sets of eigenspectra weights $\mathbf{w}_{\in (\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b})}$, and their associated mean and covariances following the Appendix of \iancze, and yielding:

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{M}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{a}}) + q \Omega_b (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{b}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{C}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{a}} \mathbf{X}^T + q \Omega_b^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{b}} \mathbf{X}^T + \mathsf{C}
  \label{eqn:modC}
\end{equation}

In short, here is what we know about \name.  It is a weak-lined \emph{T-Tauri} star.  It exhibits a 3.36-3.37 day period \citep{1993AJ....106.1608V,1994IBVS.4042....1G}, as evinced by photometric monitoring in $BVRI$ bands.  No periodic signal is detected at $U-$band.  Section 5 of \citet{1993AJ....106.1608V}, ``More on the nature of CTT and WTT spots'' goes into detail about the whether the photometric variability is attributable to hot or cold patches.  \name has no detected M-type-or-earlier binary companion down to $0.13''$ \citep{1993A&A...278..129L}.  \name demonstrates variability in X-rays with ROSAT \citep{1994ApJ...424..237S}, with $L_{x}=2.4$ ergs/s.


\section{Challenges: Tuning the transition probability matrix}
\label{sec:MC-challenges}

Once we have the mixture model in hand, we can apply the blocked Gibbs MCMC sampling framework from \iancze.  We have added 2 more parameters ($\Omega_b, \teffb$) to the model, expanding from 6 to 8 total stellar parameters.  Unfortunately this increase in dimensionality adds considerable complexity to tuning the model.  The number of possible tuning parameters in a conventional Metropolis Hastings MCMC sampler scales as $N(N+1)/2$ CITE XX, so our 2 new parameters increased the tuning parameters from 15 to 36.  The tuning parameters are covariances between dimensions in the proposal distribution.  Luckily, most of the covariances are negligibly small.  However the $\teffa, \teffb, \Omega_a, \Omega_b$ terms are likely to be correlated, suggesting an affine transformation of the parameters would accelerate the convergence of the MCMC chains.  We experimented with some of these transformations and found that the existing stellar parameters were best, although still unacceptably correlated.
