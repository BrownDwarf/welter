\begin{abstract}
Starspots temporarily increase the opacity in stellar photospheres, impacting both their instantaneous stellar flux and the duration and efficiency of their convective energy transport during pre-main sequence stellar evolution.  The observational manifestation of local magnetic fields, starspots on young stars can cover a large fraction of the stellar surface, causing the incorrect assessment of both the effective temperature and the luminosity and therefore the placement of sources on HR diagrams.  The singleton weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 shows exceptionally large photometric modulation attributable to star spots, making it an ideal testbed for measuring starspot properties.  Infrared spectral features in high resolution IGRINS spectra indicate that 70-80\% of the surface is covered in $\teff \sim 2700-3000$ K patches of cool photosphere at the epoch of the observation.  The rest of the $20-30\%$ of the stellar surface can be thought of as either ambient photosphere, or a hot spot of $\teff\sim4200$ K.  The photometric phase curve is scaled to this filling factor to construct the fill-factor-as-a-function-of-phase.  The SED, color variability, and low-resolution optical/IR spectroscopy are registered to the filling factors at their epochs, strengthening the large filling factor and temperature contrast of the starspots through time.  The revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa4 appear much lower mass and much younger when placed on a pre-main sequence HR diagram, compared to previous estimates based only on optical spectroscopy and not taking into account the large coverage fraction of cool spots.  LkCa 4 represents the extreme end of starspot coverage, suggesting that many heavily spotted young stars have been misplaced on the observational HR diagram, leading to incorrect ages and masses and contributing, in part, to the apparent age spread observed towards young clusters.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%\subsection{Pre Main Sequence HR diagram spread}

Pre-main sequence stellar evolution is an unsolved problem \citep[see review by][]{soderblom14}.  Systematic uncertainties in ages of pre-main sequence stars lead to uncertainties in dissipation timescales of envelopes and protoplanetary disks as evaluated in global studies.  All clusters have large spreads in luminosity at any given temperature \citep[e.g.][]{reggiani11}, which frustrates the interpretation of individual star/disk properties as related to age.  

The causes of global age uncertainties and of large luminosity spreads in individual clusters are controversial.  Observationally, \citet{hartmann01} and \citet{slesnick08} argue that measurement uncertainties may mask any real differences in ages within a cluster.  In models, \citet{hartmann97} and \citet{baraffe09} describe how non-static accretion histories change the stellar contraction at early times.  Contraction rates also depend on the prescription for convection, which may vary with mass.

Magnetic activity is a likely source of significant uncertainty in both the models and observations of young low-mass stars. Convection at these young ages generates strong magnetic fields, as measured in Zeeman broadening and polarimetry \citep[e.g.][]{johnskrull07,donati09} and as seen in starspots \citep[e.g.][]{stauffer03,grankin08}.  Evolutionary models are just now starting to implement new prescriptions for convection with magnetic fields (\citet{somers15}, \citet{feiden16}; see also \citet{baraffe15} for an updated treatment of convection without introducing magnetic fields).  Stellar evolution models including the effect of starspots can make a coeval 10 Myr population exhibit apparent age spreads of 3$-$10 Myr, with derived masses biased towards lower masses \citep{somers15}.  

Starspots may also be responsible for biases in stellar effective temperatures derived by different methods.  For example, effective temperatures for 3493 young stars measured using the APOGEE spectrograph \citep[$1.5-1.70 \;\mu$m at $R=22,500$][]{wilson10} are offset by 200$-$500 K ($\sim$0.02$-$0.05 dex) and as high as 1000 K ($\sim$0.1 dex) relative to previous measurements, usually from optical \citep{cottaar14}.  

% Theory of starspots
% Jackson \& Jeffries 2014ab needs to go somewhere.


Starspots have recently been observed with exceptional photometric precision from monitoring surveys targeting exoplanet transits \citep[\emph{e.g}][]{harrison11,cody14,davenport15}.  Contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous panchromatic photometric monitoring \citep{bouvier95,grankin07} can break the degeneracy between starspot areal filling factor and starspot temperature. Photometric measurements are limited to detecting large longitudinally asymmetric starspots.  Transiting planets or eclipsing binaries passing in front of starspots \citep{desert11} can break geometric degeneracies, providing estimates for the characteristic sizes and lifetimes of starspots or starspot groups.  Zeeman Doppler Imaging \citep[ZDI]{donati14} suffers from the same longitudinal asymmetry limitation as photometry, but can yield information on the latitudinal distribution of starspots.  All of these techniques would underestimate the starspot areal coverage of pole-on stars, stars with longitudinally symmetric bands of starspots, or stars with an isotropic distribution of small starspots.  

Spectroscopic strategies have the power to measure both the starspot areal coverage and temperature in any geometric configuration.  At low resolution, SED modeling \citep{wolk96} has detected evidence for sunspots in weak-lined T-Tauri stars (WTTS).  At high resolution, line depth ratio analysis has been demonstrated mostly on evolved stars in relatively small bandwidths, namely the TiO bands \citep{neff95,oneal96,oneal98,oneal04}, or the OH 1.563 $\mu$m feature \citep{oneal01}.  Past spectroscopic detections of spots on young stars have focused on TW Hya, an active accretor, and DQ Tau, a close binary in which both components are accreting \citep{debes13,bary14}.  

The WTTS \name \citep{herbig86,strom89a,downes88,strom89b} is an ideal exemplar for a spotted pre-MS star because it does not have any veiling \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{hartigan95} or mid-IR or mm excess \citep{skrutskie90,andrews05,mccabe06,furlan06,luhman10,furlan11,harris12,marichalar12,howard13,buckle15}, is not actively accreting \citep[\emph{e.g.}]{kenyon98,edwards06,cauley12,yang12}, has no evidence for a close companion \citep{karr10,kraus11,nguyen12,daemgen15}\footnote{The status for wide companions is less clear; see \citet{stauffer91,itoh08,kraus09,kraus11,herczeg14}}, and demonstrates large amplitude sinusoidal photometric variability indicative of large spots \citep{grankin08,xiao12}.    The spectrum of \name should be devoid of complicating factors like near-IR excess veiling and accretion excess.  

LkCa 4 has recently been examined with ZDI \citep{donati14}.  Unanswered questions about the large disagreement ($\Delta \teff \sim$500 K) in LkCa 4's effective temperature \citep{herczeg14} remain.

In this work, we constrain the starspot properties of \name with 4 complementary techniques.  Section \ref{sec:obs} quantifies the optical variability of \name over the last 31 years based on all available photometric monitoring; a collection of spectral observations at various phases of variability is introduced.  Section \ref{sec:methods} and Appendix \ref{methods-details} describe a spectral inference technique aimed at generalizing line depth ratio analysis, which is applied to a high resolution panchromatic near-IR spectrum of \name in Section \ref{sec:two_tempIGRINS} .  Sections \ref{sec:SED}, \ref{sec:rotSpot}, and \ref{sec:RotTiO} show results from SED fitting, polychromatic photometric monitoring, and optical TiO line-depth ratio fitting.  All lines of evidence are ultimately combined to build a consistent picture of the spectral and temporal evolution of \name, and what can be understood about pre-MS stellar evolution from this exemplar.


\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs} 

\subsection{IGRINS Spectroscopy}\label{sec:igrins} 
We acquired observations with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph, IGRINS \citep{park14} on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory on 2015-11-18 $09^h$ UTC.  IGRINS is a high resolution near-infrared echelle spectrograph providing simultaneous $R\simeq45,000$ spectra over 1.48-2.48 \um.  The spectrograph has two arms with 28 orders in $H-$band and 25 orders in $K-$band \citep{gully12}.  The data were reduced with the Pipeline Package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/igrins/plp}}.  Telluric correction was performed by dividing the spectrum of \name by a spectrum of HR 1237, an A0V star observed immediately before \name, both at airmass 1.1.  The broad hydrogen lines in the A0V star produced broad flux excesses in the spectrum of LkCa 4.  No effort was made to remove these flux excesses, which affect several spectral orders. 


\subsection{ESPaDOnS Spectroscopy}
We used ESPaDOnS on CFHT to obtain twelve high resolution optical spectra of \name from 8-21 Jan.~2014 as part of the MATYSSE Large Program.  These spectra cover 3900$-$10000 \AA\ at $R\sim68,000$ and were obtained in spectropolarimetry mode.  The Zeeman Doppler Imaging obtained from these observations were analyzed by \citet{donati14}.  In this paper, we concentrate on the intensity spectrum.

\subsection{Low-resolution optical and near-IR spectra}

The Palomar/DBSP \citep{oke82} data was previously described in \citet{herczeg14}.  Briefly, these flux-calibrated spectra cover 3000$-$8700 $\AA$ at a spectral resolution $R\sim500-700$ in two epochs.  The DBSP data were acquired near-contemporaneously with near-IR spectra from APO/TripleSpec \citep{wilson04}. \todo{(Covey) Fill in details about TripleSpec data}


\subsection{Photometric monitoring}

An archive of 1216 $B$, $V$ and/or $R$ photometric monitoring visits was assembled from published and unpublished data sources spanning 31 years in 22 observing seasons.  Published data targeting \name is composed of 29 $BVR$ visits from 1985$-$1986 \citep{vrba93}, 26 $BVR$ epochs from 1990$-$1991 \citep{bouvier93}, 284 visits in $V$-band (278 with $B$ and 268 with $R$) from 1992 August - 2004 October \citep{grankin08}, and 10 $BVR$ visits from 2013 \citep{donati14}.  ASAS3 \citep{pojmanski04} acquired 63 $V-$band measurements from 2002$-$2004.  Integral-OMC obtained 138 $V-$band measurements from 2006$-$2008 \citep{garzon12}.  The AAVSO archive \citep{kafka16} includes 385 $V$, 23 $B$ and 10 $R$ measurements from 2013$-$2016.  Unpublished data from the ASAS-SN survey \citep{shappee14} were obtained from 2012 January -- 2016 March in 186 visits.  Finally, recent photometry from the ongoing Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (CrAO) ROTOR project \citep{grankin08} is presented here for the first time.  The CrAO data includes 43 $BVR$ visits from August 2015 - March 2016. Figure \ref{fig:PhotTime} displays all the $V-$band photometry over the interval 1985-2016.  HJD, BJD, and JD are simply referred to as JD, which is accurate to the precision of available data.

The general appearance of the phase-folded lightcurves does not change with perturbations to the period on the scale of 0.003 days.  The estimated $BVR$ magnitudes at the time of the spectral observations are determined from regularized multiterm fits \citep{vanderplas15a} shown as the solid blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:PhotPhase}.  Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V} lists the estimated $BVR$ photometry and the observing epoch for data from IGRINS, ESPaDOnS, 2MASS \citep{skrutskie06}, DoubleSpec, and TripleSpec.

\section{FITS TO HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTRA}\label{sec:Starfish}

Starspots possess a spectrum distinct from the ambient photosphere.  Spatially resolved spectra of starspots have not yet been observed for stars beyond the sun, though interferometric techniques \todo{cite} and planetary transits \todo{cite} are promising.  Approaches like ZDI and line-bisector analysis \todo{cite} target the modulation of stellar photospheric lines as starspots enter and exit the observable stellar disk.  In contrast, the technique described in this Section detects and measures the spectral lines originating from starspots photospheric emission.

Starspot line depth ratio analysis has traditionally been limited to isolated portions of spectrum that possess spectral lines attributable only to starspots and spectral lines attributable only to ambient photosphere \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{neff95, oneal01}.  The apparent veiling of the lines and their respective temperature dependences can be combined to solve for the starspot and ambient photosphere temperatures and relative areal coverages.  The line depth ratio method suffers from the need to identify portions of the spectrum that possess such strong lines, and also suffers from the need to assemble large atlases of observed spectral templates to which the spotted star spectrum can be compared.  In this section, we introduce a generalization of line depth ratio analysis which employs pixel-by-pixel modeling of spectral orders.  By leveraging all the channels present in a spectrum, this strategy has the power to constrain starspot properties at relatively low fill-factors and identify weak lines that originate from the starspot.

We took two approaches to characterizing the effective temperature response from a spotted-star spectrum.  First we measured a single effective temperature to unique spectral orders in the optical (\S \ref{sec:ESP_starfish}) and near-IR (\S \ref{sec:IGR_starfish}).  Second we fit a two-temperature mixture model (\S \ref{sec:methods}) to the near-IR spectra (\S \ref{sec:two_tempIGRINS}), which should show greater starspot flux density than optical(\S \ref{sec:whyNearIR}).

\subsection{Methodology}\label{sec:methods} 

\citet[hereafter \iancze]{czekala15} developed a modular framework\footnote{The open source codebase and its full revision history is available at \url{https://github.com/iancze/Starfish}.  The experimental fork discussed in this paper is at \url{https://github.com/gully/Starfish}} to infer stellar properties from high resolution spectra.  The \iancze\ technique forward models ``emulated'' synthetic spectra from pre-computed model grids, taking into account the discretization error attributable to the coarsely sampled stellar intrinsic parameters.  We employed the \PHOENIX\ grid of pre-computed synthetic stellar spectra, which span a wide range of wavelengths at high spectral resolution with sampling of 100 K in $\teff$ in our range of interest \citep{husser13}.  The modular framework was altered to accommodate starspot measurements in two ways. First, the single photospheric component was updated to include a starspot spectrum. Second, the MCMC sampling strategy was altered to accommodate the additional free parameters added in the starspot model.

The stellar photosphere is characterized as two photospheric components with a starspot temperature $\teffb$ and ambient photosphere temperature $\teffa$, with scalar solid angular coverages $\Omega_b$ and $\Omega_a$, respectively.    Starspots (or spot groups) are assumed to be cooler than the ambient photosphere, and they share the same average intrinsic and extrinsic stellar parameters otherwise; that is $(\vsini, \logg, \Z, v_z)$ are identical for starspots and ambient photosphere.  The composite mixture model for observed flux density can be written down as:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
S_{\mathrm{mix}} = \Omega_a B(\teffa)  + \Omega_b B(\teffb)
\end{eqnarray}

where $B$ is the spectral radiance from emulated model spectra.  The observed filling factor of starspots $f_{\Omega}$ is simply the ratio:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:fill_factor}
f_{\Omega} = \frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_a + \Omega_b}
\end{eqnarray}

The term $f_{\Omega}$ represents an instantaneous, observational fill factor seen on one projected hemisphere, not $f_{\rm spot}$, the ``ratio of the spotted surface to the total surface areas'' \citep{somers15}.  In the limit of homogenously distributed spots, $f_{\Omega}$ tends to $f_{\rm spot}$, but in general $f_{\rm spot}$ is not a direct observable since some circumpolar regions of inclined stars will always face away from Earth; $f_{\Omega}$ can vary cyclically through rotational modulation, whereas $f_{\rm spot}$ changes secularly through starspot evolution that is not yet understood.

The starspot model includes two more free parameters than the standard \iancze\ model, namely $\teffb$ and $f_{\Omega}$.  The addition of these two parameters makes the MCMC sampling much more correlated than it was before because the relative contribution of the starspot and ambient photosphere are nearly degenerate over small changes in effective temperature.  This challenge motivated the second important change to the spectral inference framework, which involves technical aspects of switching from sampling the nuisance and stellar parameters separately in a blocked Gibbs framework to ensemble sampling using \texttt{emcee} \citep{foreman13}.  The affine-invariant \texttt{emcee} ensemble sampler is more resilient to correlations among stellar temperatures and fill factor than the Metropolis-Hastings sampler used in Gibbs sampling.  The practical effect of this switch is that all 14 stellar and nuisance parameters are fit simultaneously in a single spectral order.  Stellar parameter estimates $\vt_{o}$ are unique for each spectral order $o$, whereas the \iancze\ strategy had the power to provide a single set of stellar parameters $\vt$ that was based on all $N_{\rm ord}$ spectral orders.  The $N_{\rm ord}$ sets of inferences on $\vt_{o}$ are combined by weighted averaging point estimates of results from reliable orders, which offers resilience to flagrant calibration artifacts or conspicuous model mismatches.  This process can be thought of as a coarse approximation to the much more sophisticated spectral line outlier rejection described in \iancze.

Further details of the spectral inference methodology are described in Appendix \ref{methods-details}.


\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the ESPaDOnS spectrum}\label{sec:ESP_starfish}

We performed spectral fitting on the ESPaDOnS spectrum acquired on 2014 January 11, the fourth ESPaDOnS spectrum from Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V}.  The spectrum was apportioned into subsets of $N=35$ chunks, corresponding approximately to spectral order boundaries.  Full-spectrum fitting was performed separately on each of 35 spectral orders following the Metropolis-Hasting MCMC sampling procedure described in \iancze.  The spectral emulator was trained on stellar parameters in the range $\logg \in [3.5, 4.0]$, $\Z \in [-0.5, 0.5]$, and $\teff \in [3500, 4200]$.

The Metropolis-Hastings step sizes were tuned with several iterations of burn-in procedure and the final chains were visually checked for convergence.  Nine of the 35 available spectral orders failed to converge, due to numerical artifacts arising from poor model fits.  For the other 26 spectral orders, the number of samples was generally much longer than the estimated integrated autocorrelation length.  Overlays of models with observed spectra show modest agreement, with the exception of conspicuous spectral line outliers.  No attempt was made to downweight spectral-line outliers as described in \iancze.  

We computed the median value and 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentiles of burned-in subsets of the MCMC samples described above.  Overall the 26 sets of point estimates for stellar parameters show relatively good agreement, with exceptions.  We have little constraint on $\logg$ and $\Z$ since full-spectrum fitting tends to wash out the weak signal contained in line wings for spectra with a finite level of random noise and systematic error.  Meanwhile, strong metal lines can bias estimates of $\Z$ at the expense of estimates for $\teff$.  Estimates for $v_z \sim 15.6 \pm 0.6$ km/s and $\vsini \sim 28.0 \pm 0.9$ km/s are consistent across all orders with the exception of two spectral orders at $6920 <\lambda \;(\mathrm{nm})< 7057$ and $8473 < \lambda \;(\mathrm{nm}) < 8706$ due to numerous large spectral outliers.  The more-well-behaved spectral orders show effective temperature point estimates in the range $\teff=4000\pm130$ K.  Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder} displays the $\teff$ point estimates with 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentile error bars placed at the central wavelength of each spectral order.

The IGRINS orders also show typical atmospheric transmission (red lines) in the infrared.  Unused spectral chunks are lightened.  The effective temperature derived in the $K-$band is about 800 K lower than that derived in optical.}
 \label{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the IGRINS spectrum}\label{sec:IGR_starfish}

We performed full-spectrum fitting on 32 of the 54 available IGRINS spectral orders, again fitting unique stellar parameters $\vt = (\teff, \logg, \Z)$ for each spectral order $o$.  We used the same analysis procedure as described for the ESPaDOnS spectra, with one exception.  For the IGRINS $K-$band, we employed an expanded search range for the effective temperature, $\teff \in [3000, 4200]$ K, since the IGRINS $H-$ band demonstrated some saturation at the $\teff=3500$ K lower bound.  

We find a larger dispersion in the point estimates for the stellar parameters derived from the IGRINS data than those derived in optical.  The most conspicuous trend is in the derived effective temperature as a function of wavelength shown in Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}.  The effective temperature peaks at values of $\sim4200$K in the short wavelength end of $H-$band and saturates at $<3500$ K at the long wavelength end of $H-$band.  The $K-$band shows even lower derived effective temperatures of $\sim3300$ K, or 700 K cooloer than estimated from optical.  No single temperature can describe all the spectral lines present in the high resolution optical and IR spectra.  This discrepancy is circumstantial evidence for the detection of spectral features attributable to starspots.  


\subsection{Heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines in the infrared}\label{sec:whyNearIR}

Some care should be taken when directly comparing results between the ESPaDOnS and IGRINS spectra since they were not taken at the same time.  These spectra have comparable albeit different $V_{\rm est}$ of 12.90 and 12.83 for the ESPaDOnS and IGRINS spectra respectively.  Assuming the areal coverage fraction of spots was the same or greater during the ESPaDOnS spectrum acquisition, the optical bands and short-wavelength end of $H$-band are relatively insensitive to the spectral signatures of starspots in this system.  The long wavelength portion of $H-$band and all of $K-$band are more sensitive to starspot spectral signatures than the shorter wavelength portions.

The heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines as a function of wavelength can be understood in the following way.  Starspots are cooler than their surrounding photosphere and will, therefore, have a longer wavelength of peak emission, according to Wein's displacement law.  The average ratio of flux density between starspot and bulk photosphere will increase with wavelength until asymptoting to a fixed value in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail \citep{wolk96}.

In summary, the visible portion of the spectrum will be dominated by the warm patches, but the contrast with the starspots will be higher.  The infrared spectrum will have a lower overall spot contrast, but will have more net starspot flux than optical.


\subsection{Two-temperature fitting to IGRINS spectra}\label{sec:two_tempIGRINS}

Full-spectrum fitting was performed for 48 of the 54 available IGRINS spectral orders as described in Section \ref{sec:methods} and Appendix \ref{methods-details}.  The MCMC samples generally had 5000 steps with 40 walkers.  The stellar parameter ranges were $\logg \in [3.5, 4.0]$ and $\Z \in [-0.5, 0.5]$; the effective temperature range was $\teffa, \teffb \in [2700, 4500]$.  $H-$band fits had normal distribution priors in place: solar metallicity to $\pm0.05$ dex, $logg=3.8\pm0.1$, and $\vsini=29\pm5$ km/s.  The MCMC chains all appeared to converge after about 1500 steps.

Marginalized distributions were computed for all 14 stellar and nuisance parameters by selecting the final 200 $\times$ 40 walkers = 8000 samples, and point estimates were obtained by computing the median, $5^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentiles of the marginal distributions.  The fit quality was first assessed by examining the consistency of the point estimates of $v_z$ and $\vsini$ across the spectral orders.  The distribution of $v_z$ and $\vsini$ exposed extremely poor fits in two orders ($o=91$ and $94$), with all other orders demonstrating $v_z = 12.4 \pm 2.6$ km/s and $\vsini = 28.8 \pm 2.0$ km/s.  

Overplotting forward-modeled spectra with the observed IGRINS spectra yielded insights on why some spectral orders performed better than others in assessing stellar properties.  This model comparison is performed by sorting the 8000 samples by their fill factor estimates and examining random draws of the cool spectrum, hot spectrum, and composite spectrum, excluding the Gaussian process coveriance and white noise steps.  Fitting defects were conspicuous.  Orders with extremely poor telluric correction residuals, large spectral line outliers, and uncorrected H line residuals from A0V standard division, were all excluded from our final stellar parameter compilation.  Notably, several orders in $K-$band were rejected due to large biases in metallicity, since $K-$band had uninformative priors on $\Z$, resulting in overfitting of orders possessing deep metal lines.  For example, orders $o=$ 79 and 81 overfit Ca~I and Na~I lines and orders $o=74-76$ overfit the CO lines, which are known for their gravity sensitivity \todo{cite}.  These and other metal lines can also be biased by Zeeman broadening, which could explain the heightened effect size with wavelength \todo{cite}.  Additionally, some orders without these conspicuous faults, but simply possessing mediocre fits, or relatively uninformative fits, were also removed from downstream estimates.  What's left were the most informative orders relatively devoid of spectral line outliers.  Figure \ref{fig:TwoTempResults} shows the distribution of $\teffa$ (blue shading), $\teffb$ (red shading), and $\f_{\Omega}$ (yellow shading) for all of the spectral orders, but with the rejected orders grayed out, and the most reliable spectral orders shown in bold.  The point estimates for each spectral order are listed in Appendix Table \ref{tbl_order_results}.

The $K-$band orders demonstrate much more scatter than $H-$band, with no single photospheric temperature sticking out as strongly favored, but with values of $\teffa \sim 3900$ K and $\teffb \sim 2800$ K consistent with many orders.  The $K-$band spectra possess strongly correlated residuals from poor telluric correction, as well as uncorrected hydrogen line features that appear as flux excesses after division by telluric standard spectrum.  These instrumental afflictions degraded fits to several orders.

The starspot temperature is consistent with values even lower than 2700 K, the lower limit of the temperature range used.  $K-$band orders show lower estimates for the ambient photosphere, though some of these estimates are unreliable due to spectral line outliers}

Figures \ref{fig:Hband3x7} and \ref{fig:Kband3x7} in the Appendix show 42 of the $H-$ and $K-$band spectra on a log scale with a single random composite model spectrum overplotted.  The red and blue lines show the hot photosphere and cool spot spectra respectively.  We inspected the quality of the fits, generally finding good agreement with most spectral orders.  Many orders demonstrated spectral line outliers.  Most of the gross spectral features are captured by the composite model.  There are many examples of spectral lines that are present only in the hot photosphere model, or only in the cool photosphere model.  \todo{Insert new figure and text here.} For example, the OH 1.563 $\mu$m line noted by \citet{oneal01} shows a clear pattern of 3 lines in the data, with the central line exceeding the depth of the adjacent two lines.  

Best fit values for the stellar parameters summarized are listed in Table \ref{tbl_adopted_props}.  Remarkably, the filling factor of starspots exceeds 50\% with a best fit value of $f_{\Omega}=75\pm 10 \% $.

\section{Spots at Low Spectral Resolution}

In the previous section, we established that the high resolution optical and near-IR spectra of LkCa 4 may be explained by a two-temperature photosphere.  The rotation of the hot component around the star has testable predictions for the spectral energy distribution (SED) and its rotational modulation.  In the following subsections, we use these results to reproduce the SED and low-resolution spectra (\S 4.2), rotational modulation of colors \S 4.3, and rotational modulation of spectral indices (\S 4.4).  The tests presented in this section confirms that the two temperature solution is reasonable and explains features that cannot be explained with single temperature photospheres without any adjustment to the best-fit solution found in \S 3.

\label{fig:vband_spot}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{The $V$-band lightcurve and spot coverage}\label{sec:rotSpot1}

The  $V$-band brightness corresponds to a filling factor of the cool spot based on two temperatures fit from IGRINS spectra.  We adopt photosphere components of 2800 K covering 80\% of the visible stellar surface and 4200 K covering 20\% of the stellar surface at the time of the IGRINS spectrum, with an estimated $V_{rm est}=12.84$.  These parameters are selected as roughly the median of the range of acceptable temperatures and filling factors from \S 3, and are selected blindly with respect to the ability to reproduce the broadband SED and spectra.

The $V$-band emission is dominated by the hotter component and is therefore a good proxy for the visible surface area of the hot component.  Figure~\ref{fig:vband_spot} shows the recent ASAS-SN lightcurve, converted into a cool spot filling factor.  In these epochs, the brightest and coolest phase corresponds to cool component fill factors of $74\%$ and $86\%$, respectively.  Since 1992 the $V$ band photometry has been as bright as $12.3$ mag, corresponding to a cool component fill factor of $65\%$, and as faint as $13.2$ mag, or a cool component fill factor of $87\%$.  This drastic change in visible area of the hot spot (35\% to 13\%) is needed to explain the full $\sim 1$ mag range in brightness.

Cooler photospheres predict molecular bands at $<0.7$ $\mu$m that are much deeper than observed.  The two temperature photosphere accurately fits spectral features in the optical and near-IR.}
 \label{fig:lores}
\end{figure*}



\subsection{The Spectral Energy Distribution}\label{sec:SED}

Figures~\ref{fig:sed}-\ref{fig:lores} compares synthetic spectra from the two-component photosphere to the SED and flux-calibrated spectra of LkCa 4.  The only free parameters are the luminosity and extinction, which are both scaled to match the spectrum as described below.  The optical-IR SED is obtained from estimating photometry from \citet{grankin08} during the 2MASS epoch.  The SED also includes mid-IR photometry from Spitzer/IRAC \citep{hartmann05}, without adjusting for epoch.  In the spectroscopic comparison, some minor discrepancies between the optical and near-IR spectra may be introduced because the spot coverage changed in the $\sim 5$ hrs between observations.  The synthetic spectrum is obtained from the Phoenix models, as in \S 3, and is extended beyond the longest wavelength (5 $\mu$m) for calculating the bolometric luminosity.

These comparisons require extinction estimates.  The $B-V$ color from \citet{grankin08} has an 
excess $E(B-V)=0.15$ mag relative to empirical colors of a 4200 K main sequence star and a 
$0.27$ mag excess for a pre-main sequence star \citep{kenyon95,pecaut13}.  The $B-V$ color 
excess leads to an extinction $A_V=0.45\pm0.15$ mag, or $0.84\pm0.15$ mag relative to 
pre-main sequence colors.   The listed uncertainty corresponds to colors of 
4100--4300 K temperature photospheres.  The main sequence colors are probably most 
appropriate in this analysis because they are more free of spots.    
This extinction is overestimated if cooler temperatures also contribute to optical 
emission in a multi-temperature photosphere.  In the near-IR, the estimated $V=12.61$ 
at the time of the 2MASS observations leads to a template (main sequence) color 
$J-K_s=0.85$, with a range of $\sim 0.04$ for acceptable solutions with other 
temperatures and covering fractions. The observed $J-K=0.93$ leads to $A_V=0.47$ mag, 
with a range of 0.23 to account for the range of other photospheric solutions.  
The template near-IR color is more robust than optical colors to differences 
in the main sequence/pre-main sequence temperature scales because the pre-main 
sequence $J-K$ color is redder at 4200 K and bluer at 2800 K.  Baed on this 
analysis, an $A_V=0.5$ mag is adopted throughout this paper.  More accurate 
extinction estimates from the full SED are challenging because they depend on the 
areal distribution of temperatures in the photosphere, which in this work is 
simplified to two temperatures.  {\bf GJH note:  this last sentence and the 
generic approach tells the reader that we don't know how to do SED fitting, 
which sounds extremely embarrassing.  I think it's also correct.}


The synthetic models match the full spectrum reasonably well.  When scaled separately to the red-optical and near-IR spectra, the synthetic models match even better (Figure \ref{fig:lores_twopanel}).  However, single temperature photospheres (two shown in Figure \ref{fig:lores_twopanel}) fail to reproduce large spectral features.   The $3900$ K component fits the TiO bands reasonably well at $<7400$ \AA\ but fails to reproduce molecular bands at longer wavelengths.  The $3500$ K component hotter component suffers from the opposite problem, yielding molecular bands at short wavelengths that are too deep.  A two temperature photosphere with the parameters from the best-fit calculated in \S 3 fits both the molecular bands in the optical and near-IR spectra.



\subsection{Rotational Modulation of Colors}\label{sec:rotSpot}

The relative contributions from the hot and cool components change as LkCa 4 rotates, leading to rotational modulation of colors.  We model this rotational modulation using the main sequence colors compiled by \citet{pecaut13}, which should have less contribution from spots than their pre-main sequence colors.  Synthetic photometry obtained from Phoenix (or BT-Settl) spectra cannot be used here because the predicted $B-V$ colors are much bluer than observed.

The optical emission is dominated by the hotter component while both components contribute equally to the infrared emission (see Figure \ref{fig:lores}).  Figure~\ref{fig:colors} demonstrates that the $B-V$ color from \citet{grankin08} does not depend on $V$, which is consistent with expectations for a single hot component with no contributions from the cooler component.  The range of 0.03 mag in $B-V$ color indicates that the spot temperature is stable to 60 K.  The predicted colors from rotational modulation do not match the observed $V-R_J$ colors or the correlation with $V$, either because of changes in spot properties since the \citet{grankin08} data were obtained or because a two-temperature model for the photosphere is overly simplistic.

Rotational modulation is expected to lead to much smaller brightness changes at near-IR wavelengths than at optical wavelengths (see Table~\ref{tab:photrange}).  The smaller amplitude of near-IR brightness is also seen in a few spotted stars in the optical/IR monitoring of NGC 2264 \citep{cody14}, although those stars have a much smaller $V$ band amplitude than LkCa 4.

\subsection{Rotational Modulation of TiO Depth}\label{sec:RotTiO}

The depths of TiO and other molecular bands are common diagnostics of spectral type (and therefore temperature) in optical spectra \citep[e.g.][]{kirkpatrick91}.  In a 2-temperature photosphere cool enough for molecules to form, the depth of observed TiO bands will depend on the fractional coverage of the components.  In this subsection, we demonstrate that the TiO band depths vary with spot coverage using 12 epochs of CFHT/ESPaDOnS spectra obtained over 14 days ($\sim 4$ rotation periods) by \citet{donati14}.

The spectra obtained near the estimated maximum and minimum optical brightness are shown in the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:tiovar}.  Small but significant changes are seen in the TiO bands.  The blue spectrum does not change.  The TiO band depths in these spectra are measured from spectral indices listed in Table~\ref{tab:tio}  {\bf GJH:  Is this needed?}.  The TiO indices are also combined into a single TiO index by calculating the number of standard deviations each point is from the median value of the index and then averaging the standard deviation.  

Both the raw TiO 7140 index and this combined TiO index correlate strongly with the optical brightness.  In the spectral type scheme derived by \citet{herczeg14}, the change in TiO-7140 index corresponds to a range from M1.5 (3640 K) to M2.2 (3530 K).  These results are consistent with expectations from the rotational modulation of the hot spot.  The TiO bands trace the cool component.  When the hotter component has a larger filling fraction, the TiO bands are veiled by the hotter component and are therefore not as deep.

\subsection{Placing LkCa 4 on an HR Diagram}

\begin{figure*}

 \caption{Locations for LkCa 4 on an HR diagram, compared with models of pre-main sequence evolution calculated by \citet{baraffe15} with isochrones (black lines) and evolution models of a single mass (dashed blue lines) as marked.  The measured effective temperature and luminosity from this paper, based on the two-component fit and a median $V$-band magnitude, corresponds to the black asterisk.  The yellow shaded region corresponds to the range of apparent effective temperatures that are would be measured as the hot component rotates into and out of our view.  The blue circle corresponds to the measurement at blue-optical wavelengths by \citet{donati14}, the purple square corresponds to the measurement from low-resolution optical spectra, biased to TiO band strengths, by \citet[][biased to]{herczeg14}, while the red diamond corresponds to what we would measure from the K-band spectrum and 2MASS $J$-band magnitude.}
 \label{fig:hrdiag}
\end{figure*}

The spectrum of LkCa 4 is well reproduced by a cool component of $2800$ K covering 80\% of the surface and a $4200$ K component covering 20\% of the surface.   Scaling this composite spectrum for LkCa 4 to the observed $K$-band photometry yields $R=2.2$ $R_\odot$ and $\log L/L_\odot=0.17$, assuming $A_V=0.5$ mag and a distance of 131 pc for the parallax distance of the nearest Taurus member \citep{torres12}.  Brief discussion of other datapoints, based on Somers comments...

The effective temperature of these two components is 3611 K, as calculated from the average surface flux at the median $V$ band magnitude.  The apparent effective temperature in any single epoch would depend on the relative fractions of the hot and cool spot.  Decreasing the cool spot size to 60\% would increase the effective temperature to 3670 K, while increasing the spot size to 85\% would decrease the effective temperature to 3370 K.

This wide range of possible observed temperatures at any single epoch, when having the most possible information, underscores the difficulty in placing young stars on HR diagrams.  Since the Hayashi tracks are nearly vertical at this temperature and age, the temperature uncertainty leads directly to an uncertainty in inferred mass.  The discrepancies in temperature are even larger when spectral type/temperature estimates focus on features in either blue-optical or $H$ or $K$-band spectra, and may explain the severe differences in effective temperature between APOGEE and other (optical) methods \citep{cottaar14}.  For LkCa 4, the spectral type measured from TiO depths is reasonably close to the median value \citep{herczeg14}, which supports the widespread use of red spectra for effective temperatures \citep[e.g.][]{luhman03}.  The temperature uncertainties for young K and M dwarfs are likely larger than any formal uncertainties in the measurements.

{\bf GJH note:  I think this gets pretty rambling}

The multi-temperature photosphere may also resolve some of the long-standing problems related to discrepancies between observed and model colors of young stars.  Low mass young stars are redder than expected in the near-IR \citep[e.g.][]{tottle15}.  As a consequence, extinctions are high when measured by comparing near-IR colors to colors expected for optical spectral types.  For LkCa 4, the excess $E(J-K)$ color leads to an extinction of $1.04$ mag for a 4200 K photosphere and \citep{pecaut13} colors.  This extinction is consistent with the color and SED analysis of \citet{furlan06}.  However, this near-IR extinction is overestimated because the emission is generated from a composite spectrum and not only the hot component.  Our analysis in \S 4 suggests that $A_V\approx0.5$ mag, similar to the $A_V=0.69$ mag from optical photometry \citet{kenyon95} and $A_V=0.35$ mag from optical spectroscopy \citet{herczeg14}.

These issues likely explain why near-IR extinctions are often higher than optical extinctions for young stars \citep[see analysis in][]{herczeg14}.  Our results tentatively support the lower extinctions obtained at optical wavelengths, although the template colors used to calculate extinction is unclear.  In the \citet{pecaut13} conversions, late K spectral types lead to lower temperatures for pre-main sequence than main-sequence stars, and at the same temperature the B-V colors are redder.  The extinction to LkCa 4 and similar objects depends on whether these differences are caused by spots or gravity. 

Uncertainty in colors may be solved with self-consistent comparisons to young stars with similar spectral types, if spot coverage is also similar.  However, if the range in spot temperature/coverage in young stars is large, then extinctions measured from empirical pre-main sequence color scales may also be suspect.  The hottest temperature component dominates emission at short wavelengths and may provide the most accurate extinction estimate for non-accretors.  These color discrepancies are not problems with photospheric models or with the spectral type-effective temperature scale, although our results suggest that any single spectral type may be a misleading estimate of effective temperature.  

The improved characterization of the photospheric emission and radius of LkCa 4 should lead to more accurate estimates of mass and age from pre-main sequence tracks.  However, our effective temperature and luminosity yield a mass of 0.33 $M_\odot$ and an age of $\sim 0.5$ Myr in the \citet{baraffe15} evolutionary models.  This age is uncomfortably young and this mass is uncomfortably low.  LkCa 4 is not located deeply within a molecular cloud and is not associated with any nearby Class 0/1 stars, which would be expected for a 0.5 Myr star.  Dynamical measurements of masses of young stars with similar optical properties suggest that LkCa 4 should have a mass of $\sim 0.6-1.0$ M$_\odot$ \citep[e.g.][]{guilloteau14,czekala16,rizzuto16}.  Even though this is only a single data point, the inferred age and low mass may instead be evidence that strong magnetic fields are inhibiting convection in LkCa 4.  As a result, the surface is cooler and releases less radiation, slowing the contraction rate.  LkCa 4 then appears more luminous and cooler than expected from tracks that do not consider magnetic fields.   Inclusion of magnetic fields may help to resolve some of the age discrepancies between intermediate mass and low mass young stars \citep[e.g.][]{herczeg15}.





\subsection{Longitudinal / latitudinal spot distributions and phase}


\subsection{Addressing limitations of assumptions in the methodology}

\emph{Number of photospheric components-}  Our full spectrum fitting method assumed \emph{only} two temperature components present in the photosphere.  In reality, starspots are probably described by a range of effective temperatures like umbra, penumbra, and plages on the sun's surface.  A model possessing three unique temperatures and two unique fill factors might better approximate the minor constituents of the emergent spectrum than our two temperature model can.  Computational infeasibility limited our ability to rerun new multi-temperature models and compute model comparison diagnostics like AIC, BIC, or cross-validation \citep{ivezic14}.  Such investigations could be considered in future works, but we suspect systematic errors in the models would ultimately limit the interpretability of models with more than two temperature components.  High-precision polychromatic planetary transit photometry could offer an avenue to measure the morphologies and temperatures of starspots for the subset of transiting exoplanet host stars.
% The fact that we get consistent estimates for Teff tells us something.
% The fits are pretty good, also tells us something.
% Coarsely sampled models + spectral emulator acts as a smoother in Teff, as does the GP global covariance kernel.
%(cite Charlotte Norris CS19 poster?)

\emph{Suitability of pre-computed \PHOENIX\ model spectra, model ranges, $\A \neq 0$, and magnetic fields-} We have assumed that the \PHOENIX\ synthetic spectra are a good representation of our observed IGRINS spectrum of \name, a young star likely to possess a large magnetic field.  Cool sunspots are associated with heightened magnetic fields on the sun.  Magnetic fields will have two effects on the emergent spectrum- line broadening attributable to the Zeeman effect, and pressure broadening attributable to seeing deeper into deeper layers in the photosphere compared to the surrounding hotter photosphere.  The former effect will differentially impact lines with high Lande-g factors (cite XX, fix the g formatting).  The latter effect could masquerade as an apparent shift in surface gravity, as seen in mixture models of spotted stars with empirical templates composed of dwarfs and giants (cite XX Saar and collaborators).  Our tacit assumption has been that these effects are 1) relatively small compared to the gross appearance and disappearance of spectral lines at disparate temperatures and 2) there exist many orders and lines that are not affected at all.  We see tentative evidence for physics outside of the pre-computed model grids in the poor fits to the observed spectra in $K-$band.  Strong metal lines demonstrate large departures in their best fit $\Z$ due to Zeeman broadening.  No pre-computed model grids including a range of surface magnetic fields are available at the wavelength range and spectral sampling needed to approach these questions within this spectral inference framework.
% Note that these two effects would differently affect the spectra

%Our Gaussian process inference framework yields some resilience to the former problem.

\section{Methodological details}
\label{methods-details}

\subsection{Addressing absolute flux calibration}
If the stellar models are in absolute flux units, our mixture model is complete as stated in Equation \ref{eqn:mix_M}.  However \iancze\ employ \emph{standardized} $\flam$ when constructing the forward model $\vM$:


\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:normalization}
\bar \flam = \frac{\flam}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \flam d\lambda} = \frac{\flam}{f}
\end{eqnarray}

The reason for standardizing the flux is a matter of practicality: the number of PCA eigenspectra components in the spectral emulator scales steeply with the pixel-to-pixel variance of $f_{\lambda}(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$, increasing the computational cost of spectral emulation.  The choice to standardize fluxes makes no difference for modeling a single photospheric component.  But for two-component photosphere models, the relative flux of the two model spectra needs to be accounted for to get an accurate estimate of the areal coverage fraction of the cool spots, $f_{\Omega} \equiv \Omega_b/(\Omega_a+\Omega_b)$.  So we scale the mixture model in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:norm_scaling}
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}} &=& f_{\mathrm{a}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + f_{\mathrm{b}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b \\
q &=& q(\vt_{\ast})\equiv \frac{f_{\mathrm{b}}(\teffb, ...)}{f_{\mathrm{a}}(\teffa, ...)} \\
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}}^{\prime} &=& \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + q \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}

where the prime symbol in the final line indicates a re-standarized mixture model flux, where the relative fluxes of the model components are now correctly scaled.

We are then tasked with computing an estimator, $\hat f(\vt_{\ast})$, for estimating the scale factor $q$ in-between model gridpoints.  The Right Thing to Do would be to follow \iancze\ by training a Gaussian process on the $f(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$.  What We Actually Did was linearly interpolate between the model grid-points.  Interpolation can cause pile-up near model grid-points, as noted in \citet{cottaar14}, which motivated the spectral emulation procedure in \iancze.  We assume the interpolation of $\hat f$ is smooth enough that we will not see such pileups and if even we did see pileups, they would mostly be discernable as kinks in the distribution of samples in the starspot coverage fraction $f_{\Omega}$.  One drawback of our estimator method compared to the Gaussian Process regression method is that we do not propagate the uncertainty associated with the absolute flux ratio interpolation into our estimate of $f_{\Omega}$.  We assume this uncertainty is relatively small and can be ignored.

The mixture model is a linear operation with all the same stellar extrinsic parameters, so we can re-use all the same post-processed eigenspectra $\widetilde{\mathbf{\Xi}}$, mean spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\mu$, and variance spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\sigma$, with the tildes representing all post processing \emph{except} the $\Omega$ scaling.  We calulate \emph{two} sets of eigenspectra weights $\mathbf{w}_{\in (\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b})}$, and their associated mean and covariances following the Appendix of \iancze, and yielding:

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{M}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{a}}) + q \Omega_b (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{b}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{C}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{a}} \mathbf{X}^T + q \Omega_b^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{b}} \mathbf{X}^T + \mathsf{C}
  \label{eqn:modC}
\end{equation}

\comm{It's not clear if we need this table.  If we keep it, we should update it with a reliability index or note about which orders were used in deriving the final values.  A better table might be a list of new spectral features attributable to the spot.}
