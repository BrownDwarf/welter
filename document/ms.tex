\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%\subsection{Pre Main Sequence HR diagram spread}

Pre-main sequence stellar evolution is an unsolved problem \citep[see review by][]{soderblom14}.  Systematic uncertainties in ages of pre-main sequence stars lead to uncertainties in dissipation timescales of envelopes and protoplanetary disks as evaluated in global studies.  All clusters have large spreads in luminosity at any given temperature \citep[e.g.][]{reggiani11}, which frustrates the interpretation of individual star/disk properties as related to age.  

The causes of global age uncertainties and of large luminosity spreads in individual clusters are controversial.  Observationally, \citet{hartmann01} and \citet{slesnick08} argue that measurement uncertainties may mask any real differences in ages within a cluster.  In models, \citet{hartmann97} and \citet{baraffe09} describe how non-static accretion histories change the stellar contraction at early times.  Contraction rates also depend on the prescription for convection, which may vary with mass.

Magnetic activity is a likely source of significant uncertainty in both the models and observations of young low-mass stars. Convection at these young ages generate strong magnetic fields, as measured in Zeeman broadening and polarimetry \citep[e.g.][]{johnskrull07,donati09} and as seen in starspots \citep[e.g.][]{stauffer03,grankin08}, which cause significant jitter in radial velocity surveys for young planets \citep[e.g.][]{donati14}.  Evolutionary models are just now starting to implement new prescriptions for convection with magnetic fields (\citet{somers15}, \citet{feiden16}; see also \citet{baraffe15} for an updated treatment of convection without introducing magnetic fields).  Stellar evolution models including the effect of starspots can make a coeval 10 Myr population exhibit apparent age spreads of 3$-$10 Myr, with derived masses biased towards lower masses \citep{somers15}.  

Starspots may also be responsible for biases in stellar effective temperatures derived by different methods.  For example, effective temperatures for 3493 young stars measured using the APOGEE spectrograph ($1.5-1.70 \;\mu$m at $R=22,500$) are offset by 200$-$500 K ($\sim$0.02$-$0.05 dex) and as high as 1000 K ($\sim$0.1 dex) relative to previous measurements, usually from optical \citep{cottaar14}.  

% Theory of starspots
% Jackson \& Jeffries 2014ab needs to go somewhere.


Starspots have recently been observed with exceptional photometric precision from monitoring surveys targeting exoplanet transits \citep{harrison11,davenport15}.  Contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous panchromatic photometric monitoring \citep{bouvier95,grankin07} can break the degeneracy between starspot areal filling factor and starspot temperature. Photometric measurements are limited to detecting large longitudinally asymmetric starspots.  Transiting planets or eclipsing binaries passing in front of starspots \citep{desert11} can break geometric degeneracies, providing estimates for the characteristic sizes and lifetimes of starspots or starspot groups.  Zeeman Doppler Imaging \citep[ZDI]{donati14} suffers from the same longitudinal asymmetry limitation as photometry, but can yield information on the latitudinal distribution of starspots.  All of these techniques would underestimate the starspot areal coverage of pole-on stars, stars with longitudinally symmetric bands of starspots, or stars with an isotropic distribution of small starspots.  

Spectroscopic strategies have the power to measure both the starspot areal coverage and temperature in any geometric configuration.  At low resolution, SED modeling \citep{wolk96} has detected evidence for sunspots in weak-lined T-Tauri stars (WTTS).  At high resolution, line depth ratio analysis has historically been demonstrated on evolved stars in relatively small bandwidths, namely the TiO bands \citep{neff95,oneal96,oneal98,oneal04}, or the OH 1.563 $\mu$m feature \citep{oneal01}. 


Past spectroscopic detections of spots on young stars have focused on TW Hya, an active accretor, and DQ Tau, a close binary in which both components are accreting \citep{debes13,bary14}.  The WTTS \name \citep{herbig86,strom89a,downes88,strom89b} is an ideal exemplar for a spotted pre-MS star because it does not have any veiling \citep{hartigan95} or mid-IR or mm excess \citep{skrutskie90,andrews05,mccabe06,furlan06,luhman10,furlan11,harris12,marichalar12,howard13,buckle15}, is not actively accreting \citep{hartigan95,kenyon98,edwards06,cauley12,yang12,ardila13,castro13,loyd14,martinez15}, has no evidence for a close companion \citep{karr10,kraus11,daemgen15}\footnote{The status for wide companions is less clear; see \citet{stauffer91,itoh08,kraus09,kraus11}}, demonstrates large amplitude sinusoidal photometric variability indicative of large spots \citep{grankin08,xiao12}, has recently been examined with ZDI \citep{donati14}, and has large ($\Delta \teff \sim$500 K) disagreement about its effective temperature \citep{herczeg14}.  The spectrum of \name should be devoid of complicating factors like near-IR excess veiling and accretion excess.

In this work we constrain the starspot properties of \name with 4 complementary techniques.  Section \ref{sec:obs} quantifies the optical variability of \name over the last 31 years based on all available photometric monitoring; a collection of spectral observations at various phases of variability is introduced.  Section \ref{sec:methods} and Appendix \ref{methods-details} describe a spectral inference technique aimed at generalizing line depth ratio analysis, which is applied to a high resolution panchromatic near-IR spectrum of \name in Section \ref{sec:two_tempIGRINS} .  Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 show results from SED fitting, polychromatic photometric monitoring, and optical TiO line-depth ratio fitting.  All lines of evidence are ultimately combined to build a consistent picture of the spectral and temporal evolution of \name, and what can be understood about pre-MS stellar evolution from this exemplar.


\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs} 

\subsection{IGRINS Spectroscopy}\label{sec:igrins} 
We acquired observations with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph, IGRINS \citep{gully12,park14} on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory on 2015-11-18 $09^h$ UTC.  IGRINS is a high resolution near-infrared echelle spectrograph providing simultaneous $R\simeq45,000$ spectra over 1.48-2.48 \um.  The spectrograph has two arms with 28 orders in $H-$band and 25 orders in $K-$band.  The data were reduced with the Pipeline Package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/igrins/plp}}.  Telluric correction was performed by dividing the spectrum of \name by a spectrum of HR 1237, an A0V star observed immediately before \name, both at airmass 1.1.  The broad hydrogen lines in the A0V star produced broad flux excesses in the spectrum of \name.  No effort was made to remove these flux excesses, which affect several spectral orders. 


\subsection{ESPaDOnS Spectroscopy}
We used ESPaDOnS on CFHT to obtain twelve high resolution optical spectra of \name from 8-21 Jan.~2014 as part of the MATYSSE Large Program.  These spectra cover 3900$-$10000 \AA\ at $R\sim68,000$ and were obtained in spectropolarimetry mode.  The Zeeman Doppler Imaging obtained from these observations were analyzed by \citet{donati14}.  In this paper we concentrate on the intensity spectrum.

\subsection{Photometric monitoring for 22 seasons over 31 years}

An archive of 1173 $B$, $V$ and/or $R$ photometric monitoring visits was assembled from published and unpublished data sources spanning 31 years in 22 observing seasons.  Published data targeting \name\ is composed of 29 $BVR$ visits from 1985$-$1986 \citep{vrba93}, 26 $BVR$ epochs from 1990$-$1991 \citep{bouvier93}, 284 visits in $V$-band (278 with $B$ and 268 with $R$) from 1992 August - 2004 October \citep{grankin08}, and 10 $BVR$ visits from 2013 \citep{donati14}.  ASAS3 \citep{pojmanski04} acquired 63 $V-$band measurements from 2002-2004.  Integral-OMC obtained 138 $V-$band measurements from 2006-2008 \citep{garzon12}.  The AAVSO archive \citep{kafka16} includes 385 $V$, 23 $B$ and 10 $R$ measurements from 2013$-$2016.  Finally, unpublished data from the ASAS-SN survey \citep{shappee14}, were obtained from 2012 January -- 2016 March in 186 visits.  Figure \ref{fig:PhotTime} displays all the $V-$band photometry over the interval 1986-2016.

We estimate $\hat V$, the $V-$band magnitude at the time of the spectral observations, from a regularized multiterm fit \citep{vanderplas15a} shown as the solid blue line in Figure \ref{fig:PhotPhase}.  Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V} lists $\hat V$ and the observing epoch for the spectral observations with ESPaDoNs and IGRINS.

\section{FITS TO HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTRA}\label{sec:Starfish}

\todo{Provide overview of section...}

\subsection{Methodology}\label{sec:methods} 

\citet[hereafter \iancze]{czekala15} developed a modular framework\footnote{The open source codebase and its full revision history is available at \url{https://github.com/iancze/Starfish}.  The experimental fork discussed in this paper is at \url{https://github.com/gully/Starfish}} to infer stellar properties from high resolution spectra.  The \iancze\ technique forward models ``emulated'' synthetic spectra from pre-computed model grids, taking into account the discretization error attributable to the coarsely sampled stellar intrinsic parameters.  We employed the \PHOENIX\ grid of pre-computed synthetic stellar spectra that span a wide range of wavelengths at high spectral resolution with sampling of 100 K in $\teff$ in our range of interest \citep{husser13}.  The modular framework was altered to accommodate starspot measurements in two ways. First, the single photospheric component was updated to includes a starspot spectrum. Second, the MCMC sampling strategy was altered to accommodate the additional free parameters added in the starspot model.

The stellar photosphere is characterized as two photospheric components with a starspot temperature $\teffb$ and ambient photosphere temperature $\teffa$, with scalar solid angular coverages $\Omega_b$ and $\Omega_a$, respectively.    Starspots (or spot groups) are assumed to be cooler than the ambient photosphere, and they share the same average intrinsic and extrinsic stellar parameters otherwise; that is $(\vsini, \logg, \Z, v_z)$ are identical for starspots and ambient photosphere.  The composite mixture model for observed flux density can be written down as:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
f_{\mathrm{mix}} = \Omega_a f(\teffa)  + \Omega_b f(\teffb)
\end{eqnarray}

The observed filling factor of starspots $c$ is simply the ratio:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:fill_factor}
c = \frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_a + \Omega_b}
\end{eqnarray}

The starspot model includes two more free parameters than the standard \iancze\ model, namely $\teffb$ and $c$.  The addition of these two parameters makes the MCMC sampling much more correlated than it was before because the relative contribution of the starspot and ambient photosphere are nearly degenerate over small changes in effective temperature.  So the second important change to the spectral inference framework involves technical aspects of switching from sampling the nuisance and stellar parameters separately in a blocked Gibbs framework to ensemble sampling using \texttt{emcee} \citep{foreman13}.  The affine-invariant \texttt{emcee} ensemble sampler is more resilient to correlations among stellar temperatures and fill factor than the Metropolis-Hastings sampler used in Gibbs sampling.  The practical effect of this switch is that all 14 stellar and nuisance parameters are fit simultaneously in a single spectral order.  So stellar parameter estimates $\vT_{o}$ are unique for each spectral order $o$, whereas the \iancze\ strategy had the power to provide a single set of stellar parameters $\vT$ that was based on all $N_{\rm ord}$ spectral orders.  The $N_{\rm ord}$ sets of inferences on $\vT_{o}$ are combined by weighted averaging point estimates of results from reliable orders, which offers resilience to flagrant calibration artifacts or clear model mismatches.  This process can be thought of as a course approximation to the much more sophisticated spectral line outlier rejection described in \iancze.

Further details of the spectral inference methodology are described in Appendix \ref{methods-details}.


\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the ESPaDoNs spectrum}

We performed spectral fitting on the ESPaDoNs spectrum acquired on 2014 January 11, the fourth spectrum from Table \ref{tbl_estimated_V}.  The spectrum was apportioned into a subsets of $N=35$ chunks, corresponding approximately to spectral order boundaries.  Full-spectrum fitting was performed separately on each of 35 spectral orders following the Metropolis-Hasting MCMC sampling procedure described in \iancze.  The spectral emulator was trained on stellar parameters in the range $\logg \in [3.5, 4.0]$, $\Z \in [-0.5, 0.5]$, and $\teff \in [3500, 4200]$.

The Metropolis-Hastings step sizes were tuned with several iterations of burn-in procedure and the final chains were visually checked for convergence.  Nine of the 35 available spectral orders failed to converge, possibly due to numerical artifacts arising from poor model fits.  For the other 26 spectral orders, the number of samples was generally much longer than the estimated integrated autocorrelation length.  Overlays of models with observed spectra show modest agreement, with the exception of conspicuous spectral line outliers.  No attempt was made to downweight spectral-line outliers as described in \iancze.  

We computed the median value and 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentiles of burned-in subsets of the MCMC samples described above.  Overall these 26 sets of point estimates for $\vT_{m}$, $\vP_m$ show relatively good agreement, with exceptions.  We have little constraint on $\logg$ and $\Z$ since full-spectrum fitting tends to wash out the weak signal contained in line wings for spectra with a finite level of random noise and systematic error.  Meanwhile, strong metal lines can bias estimates of $\Z$ at the expense of estimates for $\teff$.  We get consistent estimates for $v_z \sim 15.6 \pm 0.6$ km/s and $\vsini \sim 28.0 \pm 0.9$ km/s, with the exception of two spectral orders at $6920 <\lambda \;(\mathrm{nm})< 7057$ and $8473 < \lambda \;(\mathrm{nm}) < 8706$.  These two outlying spectral orders converged to unreasonably large values for $\vsini$ and $a_{\rm G}$, the amplitude of the Gaussian process covariance kernel.  One of these orders has an unusually small value for effective temperature, $\teff\sim3500$, comparable to the lower limit of the employed model grid.  Visual comparison of the observed spectrum for a range of fits for these orders shows that no single emulated spectrum could reasonably fit their spectrum because there are numerous large spectral outliers.  The more-well-behaved spectral orders show effective temperature point estimates in the range $\teff=4000\pm130$ K.  Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder} displays the $\teff$ point estimates with 5$^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentile error bars placed at the central wavelength of each of the 26 spectral orders.

\begin{figure*}

	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/single_Teff_v_order}
	\caption{Effective temperature as derived from unique full spectrum fitting to each of 58 spectral orders in the optical through infrared portions of the spectrum assuming a single component photosphere.  }
	\label{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Single temperature fitting to the IGRINS spectrum}

We performed full-spectrum fitting on 32 of the 54 available IGRINS spectral orders, again fitting unique stellar parameters $\vt = (\teff, \logg, \Z)$ for each spectral order $m$.  We used the same analysis procedure as described for the ESPaDoNs spectra, with one exception.  For the IGRINS $K-$band, we employed an expanded search range for the effective temperature, $\teff \in [3000, 4200]$ K, since the IGRINS $H-$ band demonstrated some saturation at the $\teff=3500$ K lower bound.  No effort was made to shift the wavelength scales of the IGRINS data and \PHOENIX\ model into the same system, so the absolute values of $v_z$ are arbitrary shifted.

We find a larger dispersion in the point estimates for the stellar parameters derived from the IGRINS data with single temperature fits.  The most conspicuous trend is in the derived effective temperature as a function of wavelength shown in Figure \ref{fig:SingleTeffvsOrder}.  Here we see dramatic result that the effective temperature peaks at a values of $\sim4200$K in the short wavelength end of $H-$band and saturates at $<3500$ K at the long wavelength end of $H-$band.  The $K-$band shows even lower derived effective temperatures of $\sim3300$ K.

\subsection{Interpretation of the single temperature fitting results}

The effective temperature derived at different wavelength intervals exhibit a $\Delta \teff \sim 800$ K spread.  No single temperature can describe all the spectral lines present in the high resolution optical and IR spectra.  This discrepancy is circumstantial evidence for the detection of spectral lines attributable to starspots.  This circumstantial evidence should not be surprising given the previous evidence that \name possesses a large coverage fraction of starspots \citep{grankin08,donati14}.

%We performed a further plausibility check to constrain the effect size of starspots.  We generated flux calibrated spectra at two temperatures, and forward-modeled them to resemble the LkCa4 IGRINS and ESPaDOnS spectra in all other ways (\emph{i.e.} $\logg, \Z, \vt_{\rm ext}$), including noise and calibration parameters.  We coadded the spectra in a mixture model:  $ \mathsf{M}_{mix} = c \cdot \mathsf{M}_A(T_\textrm{eff,A}) + (1-c) \cdot \mathsf{M}_B(T_\textrm{eff,B})$.  We chose a fill factor of starspots of 30\%.  We then re-ran our single-temperature fitting procedure on the two-temperature, synthetic, noised-up data to see what stellar parameters our full-spectrum fitting procedure would na\"{\i}vely derive.  


\subsection{Heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines in the infrared}

Some care should be taken when directly comparing results between the ESPaDoNs and IGRINS spectra since they were not taken at the same time.  These spectra have comparable albeit different $\hat V$ of 12.90 and 12.83 for the ESPaDoNs and IGRINS spectra respectively.  Assuming the areal coverage fraction of spots was the same or greater during the ESPaDoNs spectrum acquisition, the optical bands and short-wavelength end of $H$-band are relatively insensitive to the spectral signatures of starspots in this system.  The long wavelength portion of $H-$band and all of $K-$band are more sensitive to starspot spectral signatures than the shorter wavelength portions.

The heightened sensitivity to starspot spectral lines as a function of wavelength can be understood in the following way.  Starspots are cooler than their surrounding photosphere and will therefore have a longer wavelength of peak emission, according to Wein's displacement law.  The average ratio of flux density between starspot and bulk photosphere will increase with wavelength until asymptoting to a fixed value in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail \citep{wolk96}.

%In Figure XX we plot the ratio of black body flux density at temperatures 4100 K and 3300 K with a red line.  The blue line is the ratio of two smoothed \PHOENIX model spectra with 4100 K and 3300 K, solar metalicity, and $\logg=3.5$.  The flux density ratio is the flux per solid angle, so the delivered flux ratio for a finite sized starspot will depend on the (flux-weighted) solid angle of the starspot relative to the (flux-weighted) solid angle of the stellar disk, vis-a-vis Equations \ref{eqn:Mix_M} and \ref{eqn:fill_factor}.  
%\todo{Put in the flux density ratio plot.}
%\comm{Should we change the plot numbers from 4100 and 3300 to 4200 and 3000?  -These would end up being closer to the best fit values.}

In summary, the visible portion of the spectrum will be dominated by the warm patches, but the contrast with the starspots will be higher.  The infrared spectrum will have a lower overall spot contast, but will have higher relative contribution attributable to the cool patches.  This observation has motivated precision radial velocity (RV) planet searches in the infrared, where the modulation of RV signals is lessened \citep{prato08}.
%\comm{This blurb should probably go in the introduction.}


\subsection{Two-temperature fitting to IGRINS spectra}\label{sec:two_tempIGRINS}

Full-spectrum fitting was performed for 43 of the 54 available IGRINS spectral orders as described in Sectrion \ref{sec:methods} and Appendix \ref{methods-details}.  The MCMC samples had 5000 steps with 40 walkers.  The stellar parameter ranges were $\logg \in [-3.5, 4.0]$ and $\Z \in [-0.5, 0.5]$; the effective temperature range for $H-$ band was $\teffa, \teffb \in [2700, 4500]$, and was expanded to $\teffa, \teffb \in [2700, 4500]$ for $K-$band.  The MCMC chains all appeared to converge after about 1500 steps.

Marginalized point estimates were computed for all 14 stellar and nuisance parameters by selecting the final 200 $\times$ 40 walkers = 8000 samples, and computing the median, $5^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentiles of the marginal distributions.  The fit quality was assessed by examining the consistency of the point estimates across the spectral orders.  The distribution of $v_z$ and $\vsini$ were informative for finding extremely poor fits.  The range for all 43 orders was $v_z = 12.4 \pm 2.6$ and $\vsini = 28.8 \pm 2.0$.  Spectral orders $m=91$ and $94$ had exceptionally large uncertainties on their values for $v_z$ and $\vsini$, which makes sense since these two orders are badly affected by telluric absorption artifacts.

As noted previously, the full-spectrum fitting method offers little constraining power on $\logg$, and $\Z$ can be biased in the face of systematic spectral line outliers.  Estimates of $\logg$ appeared the high end of our search range, $3.5 <\logg <4.0$, yielding a median value of the point estimates of 3.8 and a standard deviation of 0.1, consistent with previously published values from \citet{donati14}.  The estimates for $\Z$ yield a slight trend with wavelength-- the longest wavelength orders tend to prefer higher metalicity, while the shorter wavelength values prefer slightly sub-solar metalicity.  Orders 79, 81, 90, and to a lesser extent 78 and 76 showed aritificially tight constraints on $\Z$, biased to large values.  Similarly, orders 86, 101, 102, 104, 106, all had $\Z$ estimates biased to extremely low values.   Visual inspection of these orders indicates that their spectrum is dominated by spectral line outliers--deep metal lines that cannot be described by a coarse metalicity estimate alone.  These spectral line outlier orders also tend to bias estimates of effective temperature.  These metal lines can also be biased by Zeeman broadening, which would explain the heightened effect size with wavelength.

Finally, the posteriors on $\teffa$ and $\teffb$ show several trends- see Figure \ref{fig:TwoTempResults} and Table \ref{tbl_order_results} for the results of effective temperatures for all IGRINS orders.  
\todo{insert results from re-run of H-band spectra here}
Nearly-equal solutions could be explained by vanishingly weak spectral lines in one or the other of the effective temperature ranges, in which case the method offers little constraint on $\teffb$, but improves the fit around $\teffa$.  

The $K-$band orders demonstrate much more scatter than $H-$band, with no single photospheric temperature sticking out as strongly favored, but with values of $\teffa \sim 3900$ K and $\teffb \sim 2800$ K consistent with many orders.  The $K-$band spectra possess strongly correlated residuals from poor telluric correction, as well as uncorrected hydrogen line features that appear as flux excessess after division by telluric standard spectrum.  These instrumental afflictions degraded fits to several orders.

Figures \ref{fig:Hband3x7} and \ref{fig:Kband3x7} in the Appendix show 42 of the $H-$ and $K-$band spectra on a log scale with a single random composite model spectrum overplotted.  The red and blue lines show the hot photosphere and cool spot spectra respectively.  We inspected the quality of the fits, generally finding remarkable agreement with most spectral orders.  Many orders demonstrated spectral line outliers, as noted in \iancze.  Most of the gross spectral features are captured by the composite model.  There are many examples of spectral lines that are present only in the hot photosphere model, or only in the cool photosphere model.  For example, the OH 1.563 $\mu$m line noted by \citet{oneal01} shows a clear pattern of 3 lines in the data, with the central line exceeding the depth of the adjacent two lines.  

Best fit values for the stellar parameters summarized are listen in Table \ref{tbl_adopted_props}.  Remarkably, the filling factor of starspots exceeds 50\% with a best fit value of $c=75\pm 10 \% $.

\section{Spots at Low Spectral Resolution}

In the previous sections we established that the high resolution optical and near-IR spectra of LkCa 4 may be explained by a cool photosphere with a hot spot.  These results have testable predictions for the spectral energy distribution (SED) and rotational modulation of features of the SED.

% quantify the spot fraction versus rotation period, and then

In \S 4.1 we describe how the two components of the photosphere fit low resolution spectra and optical/near-IR photometry.  The brightness, colors, spectral features should change as the spot rotates around the star.  In \S 4.2, we convert the $V$ brightness to a filling factor of the cool spot, and then in \S 4.2-4.3 we compare how the expected rotational modulation of photometry and spectral indices compares with observed measurements.

\subsection{The Spectral Energy Distribution}

Figure~\ref{fig:lores} shows that the two-component photosphere matches flux-calibrated spectra well from $\sim 0.6-2.5$ $\mu$m.  The two components have fixed temperatures of 4200 K covering 30\% of the visible surface and 3000 K covering 70\% of the visible surface area.  The flux and extinction are then scaled to match the spectrum.

The lower panels show photospheric spectra scaled separately to the observed red-optical and near-IR spectra.  The single temperature spectra are unable to reproduce the observed emission.  The $3900$ K component fits the TiO bands at reasonably well at $<7400$ \AA\ but fails to reproduce molecular bands at longer wavelengths.  The $3500$ K component hotter component suffers from the opposite problem, yielding molecular bands at short wavelengths that are too deep.  On the best-fit photosphere from \S 3 fits both the optical and the near-IR bands well.

SED...

The value for the extinction depends on. 

Relative to main sequence colors, the $E(B-V)=0.24$ would yield.  

%Furlan:  K7, V-IC=1.92, E(V-I)=1.6 => 0.85 mag;  close enough to their 1.1 mag
%V-K = 4.18  ; MS colors:  3.16 (KH95) => Av=1.1 mag


%V-J:  2.8-3.8
%J-K:  0.9-1.0



 The upper limit may be estimated by comparing the observed $B-V$ color to main sequence $B-V$ colors.

The $B-V$

The $J-K=0.93$ color is equal to the expected color to within 0.05 => 0.3 mag (for T=3000, 4200)

\subsection{Rotational modulation of the hot spot}

Since 1992 the $V$ band brightness has varied from $12.3$ to $13.2$ mag, with a typical range of $0.5$ mag in any single epoch.  In a two-temperature atmosphere with fixed temperatures, this brightness corresponds directly to a filling factor for both components.  Figure~\ref{vband_spot} shows this conversion for temperatures of 4200 K, 3000 K, and a 75\% filling factor for the 3000 K component at $V_{est}=12.83$, as estimated at the time of the IGRINS spectrum.  

The model photometry is obtained from the main sequence colors compiled by \citet{kenyon95}.  Colors from dwarfs stars should have minimal contribution from spots; measurements of pre-main sequence colors will include some unknown contribution of spots and cannot be used for this analysis.  Synthetic spectra of $3000-4000$ K stars predict $B-V$ colors that are much bluer than observed and that become bluer at cooler temperatures, the opposite of what is observed.  As a consequence, synthetic photometry also cannot be used here.  

The optical emission is dominated by the hotter component while both components contribute to the red and infrared emission (see Figure \ref{fig:lores}).  The $0.7$ mag range in $V$-band brightness requires at a factor of 1.9 change in the visible surface area of hot component in the limit that the cool component does not contribute any $V$-band emission.  In the 2014-2015 ASAS-SN photometry, the minimum and maximum brightness correspond to cool spot coverage of 83\% and 68\%, respectively.  LkCa 4 was brighter in past epochs, which corresponds to either a larger covering fraction for the hot component (as assumed here) or components with hotter temperatures.

The rotational modulation leads to much smaller brightness changes at near-IR wavelengths than at optical wavelengths (see Table~\ref{tab:photrange}).  The smaller amplitude of near-IR brightness is also seen in a few spotted stars in the optical/IR monitoring of NGC 2264 \citep{cody14}, although those stars have a much smaller amplitude than LkCa 4 in $V$ band.  Figure~\ref{fig:colors} demonstrates that the $B-V$ color from \citet{grankin08} does not depend on $V$, while the $V-R_J$ becomes slightly redder when $V$ is smaller.  The predicted colors from rotational modulation do not match the observed $V-R_J$ colors or the correlation with $V$, either because of changes in spot properties since the \citet{grankin08} data were obtained or because a two-temperature model for the photosphere is overly simplistic.

\subsection{Rotational Modulation of TiO Depth}

The depths of TiO and other molecular bands are common diagnostics of spectral type (and therefore temperature) in optical spectra \citep[e.g.][]{kirkpatrick91}.  In a 2-temperature photosphere, the depth of observed TiO bands will depend on the fractional coverage of the components.  In this subsection, we demonstrate that the TiO band depths vary with spot coverage.

\citet{donati14} spectroscopically monitored LkCa 4 with 12 spectra obtained over 14 days, covering $\sim 4$ rotation periods.  The top panel Figure~\ref{fig:tiovar} shows two of these spectra obtained at the estimated maximum and minimum optical brightness.  Small but significant changes are seen in the TiO bands.  The blue spectrum does not change.

The TiO variability is quantified through TiO indices listed in Table~\ref{tab:tiO}.  The TiO indices are also combined into a single index by calculating by 
calculating how many standard deviations each point is from the median value of the index, and then averaging the standard deviation.  Both the raw TiO 7140 index and this combined TiO index correlate strongly with the optical brightness.  In the spectral type scheme derived by \citet{herczeg14}, the change in TiO-7140 index corresponds to a range from M1.5 (3640 K) to M2.2 (3530 K).

\subsection{Placing LkCa 4 on an HR Diagram}

\end{figure*}

The spectrum of LkCa 4 is well reproduced by a cool component of $3000$ K covering 75\% of the surface and a $4200$ K component covering 25\% of the surface.  The effective temperature of these two components is 3525 K, based on the average surface flux.  Decreasing the cool spot size to 60\% would increase the effective temperature to 3670 K, while increasing the spot size to 85\% would decrease the effective temperature to 3370 K.  {\bf GJH note:  holy crap!!!}  Scaling our composite spectrum for LkCa 4 to the observed $K$-band photometry yields $R=2.2$ $R_\odot$ and $\log L/L_\odot=0.17$, assuming a distance of 131 pc based the parallax distance of the nearest Taurus member \citep{torres12}.

This improved characterization of LkCa 4 should lead to more accurate estimates of mass and age from pre-main sequence tracks.  However, our effective temperature and luminosity yield a mass of 0.33 $M_\odot$ and an age of $\sim 0.5$ Myr in the \citet{baraffe15} evolutionary models.  This age is uncomfortably young.  LkCa 4 is not located deeply within a molecular cloud and is not associated with any nearby Class 0/1 stars, which would be expected for a 0.5 Myr star.  The inferred age and low mass may instead be evidence that strong magnetic fields are inhibiting convection and slowing the contraction rate.

\subsection{Addressing limitations of assumptions in the methodology}

\emph{Number of photospheric components-}  Our full spectrum fitting method assumed \emph{only} two temperature components present in the photosphere.  In reality, starspots are probably described by a range of effective temperatures like umbra, penumbra, and plages on the sun's surface.  A model possessing three unique temperatures and two unique fill factors might better approximate the minor constituents of the emergent spectrum than our two temperature model can.  Computational infeasibility limited our ability to rerun new multi-temperature models and compute model comparison diagnostics like AIC, BIC, or cross validation \citep{ivezic14}.  Such investigations could be considered in future works, but we suspect systematic errors in the models would ultimately limit the interpretability of models with more than two temperature components.  High-precision polychromatic planetary transit photometry could offer an avenue to measure the morphologies and temperatures of starspots for the subset of transiting exoplanet host stars.
% The fact that we get consistent estimates for Teff tells us something.
% The fits are pretty good, also tells us something.
% Coarsely sampled models + spectral emulator acts as a smoother in Teff, as does the GP global covariance kernel.
%(cite Charlotte Norris CS19 poster?)

\emph{Suitability of pre-computed \PHOENIX\ model spectra, model ranges, $\A \neq 0$, and magnetic fields-} We have assumed that the \PHOENIX\ synthetic spectra are a good representation to our observed IGRINS spectrum of \name, a young star likely to possess a large magnetic field.  Cool sunspots are associated with heightened magnetic fields on the sun.  Magnetic fields will have two effects on the emergent spectrum- line broadening attributable to the Zeeman effect, and pressure broadening attributable to seeing deeper into deeper layers in the photosphere compared to the surrounding hotter photosphere.  The former effect will differentially impact lines with high Lande-g factors (cite XX, fix the g formatting).  The latter effect could masquerade as an apparent shift in surface gravity, as seen in mixture models of spotted stars with empirical templates composed of dwarfs and giants (cite XX Saar and collaborators).  Our tacit assumption has been that these effects are 1) relatively small compared to the gross appearance and disappearance of spectral lines at disparate temperatures and 2) there exist many orders and lines that are not affected at all.  We see tentative evidence for physics outside of the pre-computed model grids in the poor fits to the observed spectra in $K-$band.  Strong metal lines demonstrate large departures in their best fit $\Z$ due to Zeeman broadening.  No pre-computed model grids including a range of surface magnetic fields are available at the wavelength range and spectral sampling needed to approach these questions within this spectral inference framework.
% Note that these two effects would differently affect the spectra

We also assumed that the spectral pattern of metallicity can be captured by a single coarse metric, $\Z$.  In reality, the low temperature starspot spectrum of \name could exhibit $\A \neq 0$, resulting in a greater amplitude of residual spectrum correlations, and/or biased estimates for other parameters.  Our Gaussian process inference framework yields some resilence to the former problem.  For the latter, nonzero $\A$ would only impact a subset of all lines, and only to at a magnitude of typical departures of $\A$ in the solar neighborhood.  The large number of IGRINS orders and spectral lines offers us some resilience to isolated orders badly affected by spectral line outliers.

\section{Methodological details}
\label{methods-details}

\subsection{Full-spectrum fitting framework}

\iancze\ define a pixel-level forward model $\vM$ of the data.  A flexible Gaussian Process noise model handles correlations in the residual spectrum, $\vR= \vD - \vM$.  The model encapsulates the major intrinsic stellar parameters $\vt_{\ast}$ and the extrinsic stellar parameters $\vt_{\rm ext}$:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:scaling}
\vM(\vT) &=& \vM(\vt_{\ast}, \vt_{\rm ext}) \\
         &=& \vM(\vt_{\ast}, \sigma_v, v\sin{i}, v_r) \times \Omega \times 10^{-0.4\,A_{\lambda}}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The $\vt_{\ast}$ are comprised of the dimensions of the pre-computed stellar model grid.  We use the \PHOENIX\ model grid \citep{husser13}, with fixed solar alpha abundances: $\A = 0$, so $\vt_{\ast} = \{\teff, \logg, \Z \}$.

\todo{Remove the matrix/approach jargon and simplify}

\subsection{Discussion of deriving unique Teff in each order}
\label{sec:approach12}

\todo{Move or delete this section}

This change does not represent reality: by definition, the star has a single set of stellar properties, which do not depend on the wavelength range at which they are measured.  The na\"ive single-component fit to different wavelength chunks merely provides a plausibility argument for the presence of a second photospheric component if the derived $\vT_o$ show a spread in $\teff$.  

It is conceivable that other parameters, like $\logg$ could show a dependence on wavelength if non-standard physics---\emph{i.e.}physics not included in the pre-computed model grid---mimics the effect of \emph{e.g.} $\logg$ on the spectrum.  For example, magnetic fields could cause Zeeman broadening, which could alter the derived stellar parameters $\vT_o$.  For these reasons, we intentionally allowed \emph{all} the stellar parameters $\vT_o = \{T_{\mathrm{eff},o}, \log{g_o}, \Z_o, \Omega_{o}, v\sin{i}_o, v_{r,o}\}$ to vary by order.  


\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Mixture model definitions}

We construct a mixture model spectrum of the form:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
\vM_{\mathrm{mix}}(\vT) = \vM(\teffa, ...) \times \Omega_a + \vM(\teffb, ...) \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}


Where $\teffa, \teffb, \Omega_a, \Omega_b$ are temperatures and solid angles of two photospheric components respectively.  All other stellar intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and instrumental nuisance calibration parameters are shared among the two components, as chronicled in Table \ref{table:params}.

If the stellar models are in absolute flux units, our mixture model is complete as stated in Equation \ref{eqn:mix_M}.  However \iancze\ employ \emph{standardized} $\flam$ when constructing the forward model $\vM$:


\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:normalization}
\bar \flam = \frac{\flam}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \flam d\lambda} = \frac{\flam}{f}
\end{eqnarray}

The reason for standardizing the flux is a matter of practicality: the number of PCA eigenspectra components in the spectral emulator scales steeply with the pixel-to-pixel variance of $f_{\lambda}(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$, increasing the computational cost of spectral emulation.  The choice to standardize fluxes makes no difference for modeling a single photospheric component.  But for two-component photosphere models, the relative flux of the two model spectra needs to be accounted for to get an accurate estimate of the areal coverage fraction of the cool spots, $c \equiv \Omega_b/(\Omega_a+\Omega_b)$.  So we scale the mixture model in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:norm_scaling}
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}} &=& f_{\mathrm{a}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + f_{\mathrm{b}} \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b \\
q &=& q(\vt_{\ast})\equiv \frac{f_{\mathrm{b}}(\teffb, ...)}{f_{\mathrm{a}}(\teffa, ...)} \\
f_{\lambda, \mathrm{mix}}^{\prime} &=& \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{a}} \times \Omega_a + q \bar f_{\lambda, \mathrm{b}} \times \Omega_b
\end{eqnarray}

where the prime symbol in the final line indicates a re-standarized mixture model flux, where the relative fluxes of the model components are now correctly scaled.

We are then tasked with computing an estimator, $\hat f(\vt_{\ast})$, for estimating the scale factor $q$ in-between model gridpoints.  The Right Thing to Do would be to follow \iancze by training a Gaussian process on the $f(\{\vt_{\ast}\}^\textrm{grid})$.  What We Actually Did was linearly interpolate between the model grid-points.  Interpolation can cause pile-up near model grid-points, as noted in \citet{cottaar14}, which motivated the spectral emulation procedure in \iancze.  We assume the interpolation of $\hat f$ is smooth enough that we will not see such pileups and if even we did see pileups, they would mostly be discernable in the distribution of samples in the starspot areal coverage fraction $c$.  One drawback of our estimator method compared to the Gaussian Process regression method is that we do not propagate the uncertainty associated with the absolute flux ratio interpolation into our estimate of $c$.  We assume this uncertainty is relatively small and can be ignored.

The mixture model is a linear operation with all the same stellar extrinsic parameters, so we can re-use all the same post-processed eigenspectra $\widetilde{\mathbf{\Xi}}$, mean spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\mu$, and variance spectrum $\widetilde{\xi}_\sigma$, with the tildes representing all post processing \emph{except} the $\Omega$ scaling.  We calulate \emph{two} sets of eigenspectra weights $\mathbf{w}_{\in (\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b})}$, and their associated mean and covariances following the Appendix of \iancze, and yielding:

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{M}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{a}}) + q \Omega_b (\widetilde{\xi}_\mu + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathbf{w}, \mathrm{b}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathsf{C}_{\mathrm{mix}}^\prime = \Omega_a^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{a}} \mathbf{X}^T + q \Omega_b^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma}_\mathbf{w, \mathrm{b}} \mathbf{X}^T + \mathsf{C}
  \label{eqn:modC}
\end{equation}
