## Jupyter Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks contain much of the aggregate and visualization analysis.  The format is:

`welter_` + `issue` + *GitHub Issue Number* `-` *sub-task number* + `_` + A short description + `.ipynb`

Unfortunately there is no visual guide to the many notebooks, but some exploration here will reveal what's going on.  Good luck!
